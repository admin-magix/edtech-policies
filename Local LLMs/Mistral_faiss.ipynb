      "3.

      "1. The privacy policy does not explicitly state that data subjects will be informed before restrictions are lifted.

      "3. The privacy policy emphasizes the importance of protecting the company's interests, stating that \"We may also use your Personal Information to protect our rights and interests.\" This suggests that the company's primary focus is on its own interests rather than providing transparency and notification to data subjects.\n",

However, it does not specify which third parties may receive personal data or under what circumstances. Therefore, the answer is partially fulfilled.\n",

      "1. The privacy policy does not explicitly state that data subjects will be informed before restrictions are lifted.

It simply states that \"You have the right to request that we restrict the processing of your Personal Data\" without providing any further details.\n",

      "Answer: Yes.
