These special cases are covered in Articles 3.6 and 4.8 of this Policy.3.2. Conditions for consentWhen we request your consent in the context of a written declaration which also concerns other matters, the request for consent shall be presented in a manner which is clearly distinguishable from the other matters.You shall have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. The withdrawal of consent shall not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal.

Below are the specific purposes for which we use the information we collect about you.To provide the Services and personalise your experience: We use information about you to provide the Services to you, including to process transactions with you, authenticate you when you log in, provide customer support, and operate and maintain the Services. For example, we use the name and picture you provide in your account to identify you to other Service users. Our Services also include tailored features that personalise your experience, enhance your productivity and improve your learning by providing activity feeds, notifications, connections and recommendations that are most relevant for you and your team. We may use your email domain to infer your affiliation with a particular organisation or industry to personalize the content and experience you receive on our websites.For research and development: We are always looking for ways to make our Services smarter, faster, secure, integrated and useful to you. We use collective learnings about how people use our Services and feedback provided directly to us to troubleshoot and to identify trends, usage, activity patterns and areas for integration and improvement of the Services. We also test and analyse certain new features with some users before rolling the feature out to all users.To communicate with you about the Services: We may use your contact information to send transactional communications via email and within the Services, including confirming your purchases, reminding you of subscription expirations, responding to your comments, questions and requests, providing customer support, and sending you technical notices, updates, security alerts, and administrative messages.To market, promote, and drive engagement with the Services: We may use your contact information and information about how you use the Services to send promotional communications that may be of specific interest to you, including by email and by displaying Kinteract ads on other companies' websites and applications, as well as on platforms like Facebook and Google. These communications are aimed at driving engagement and maximising what you get out of the Services, including information about new features, survey requests, newsletters, and events we think may be of interest to you. We may also communicate with you about new product offers, promotions and contests. You can control whether you receive these communications as described below under \"Opt-out of communications.\"Customer support: We use your information to resolve technical issues you encounter, to respond to your requests for assistance, to analyse crash information, and to repair and improve the Services.For safety and security: We use information about you and your Service use to verify accounts and activity, to monitor suspicious or fraudulent activity and to identify violations of Service policies.To protect our legitimate business interests and legal rights: Where required by law or where we believe it is necessary to protect our legal rights, interests and the interests of others, we use information about you in connection with legal claims, compliance, regulatory, and audit functions, and disclosures in connection with the acquisition, merger or sale of a business.With your consent: We use information about you where you have given us consent to do so for a specific purpose not listed above. For example, we may publish testimonials or featured customer stories to promote the Services, with your permission.Legal bases for processing (for EEA users): If you are an individual in the European Economic Area (EEA), we collect and process information about you only where we have legal bases for doing so under applicable EU laws. The legal bases depend on the Services you use and how you use them. This means we collect and use your information only where:We need it to provide you the Services, including to operate the Services, provide customer support and personalised features and to protect the safety and security of the Services;It satisfies a legitimate interest (which is not overridden by your data protection interests), such as for research and development, to market and promote the Services and to protect our legal rights and interests;You give us consent to do so for a specific purpose; orWe need to process your data to comply with a legal obligation.If you have consented to our use of information about you for a specific purpose, you have the right to change your mind at any time, but this will not affect any processing that has already taken place. Where we are using your information because we or a third party (e.g. your employer) have a legitimate interest to do so, you have the right to object to that use though, in some cases, this may mean no longer using the Services.How we share information we collectWe provide a digital portfolio and assessment platform and we want this to work well for you. This means sharing information through the Services and with certain third parties. We may share information we collect about you in the ways discussed below but you can be rest assured that we are not in the business of selling information about you to advertisers or other third parties.Sharing with other Service usersWhen you use the Services, we share certain information about you with other Service users.For collaboration: You can create content, which may contain information about you, and grant permission to others to see, share, edit, copy and download that content based on settings you or your administrator (if applicable) select.

If a service provider needs to access information about you to perform services on our behalf, they do so under instruction from us, including abiding by policies and procedures designed to protect your information.Third-Party apps: You, your administrator or other Service users may choose to add new functionality or change the behaviour of the Services by enabling third party integrations within the Services. Doing so may give third-party apps access to your account and information about you like your name and email address, and any content you choose to use in connection with those apps. If you are an administrator or contact listed on an account, we share your details with the third-party app provider upon installation. Third-party app policies and procedures are not controlled by us, and this privacy policy does not cover how third-party apps use your information. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of third parties before connecting to or using their applications or services to learn more about their privacy and information handling practices.

While we implement safeguards designed to protect your information, no security system is impenetrable and due to the inherent nature of the Internet, we cannot guarantee that data, during transmission through the Internet or while stored on our systems or otherwise in our care, is absolutely safe from intrusion by others. We will respond to requests about this within a reasonable timeframe.How long we keep informationHow long we keep information we collect about you depends on the type of information, as described in further detail below. After such time, we will either delete or anonymise your information or, if this is not possible (for example, because the information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your information and isolate it from any further use until deletion is possible.Account information: We retain your account information until you delete your account. We also retain some of your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, to resolve disputes, to enforce our agreements, to support business operations and to continue to develop and improve our Services. Where we retain information for Service improvement and development, we take steps to eliminate information that directly identifies you, and we only use the information to uncover collective insights about the use of our Services, not to specifically analyse personal characteristics about you.Information you share on the Services: If your account is deactivated or disabled, some of your information and the content you have provided will remain in order to allow your team members or other users to make full use of the Services. For example, we continue to display comments and content you provided to cards or made assessments/reports.Managed accounts: If the Services are made available to you through an organisation (e.g., your employer or that your child attends that institution), we retain your information as long as required by the administrator of your account.

If you can deactivate your own access, that setting is available to you in your account settings. Otherwise, please contact your administrator.

For more information on how to delete your information, see below.Delete your information: Our Services and related documentation give you the ability to delete certain information about you from within the Service. For example, you can remove content that contains information about you using the key word search and editing tools associated with that content and you can remove certain profile information within your profile settings. Please note, however, that we may need to retain certain information for record keeping purposes, to complete transactions or to comply with our legal obligations.Request that we stop using your information: In some cases, you may ask us to stop accessing, storing, using and otherwise processing your information where you believe we don't have the appropriate rights to do so. For example, if you believe a Services account was created for you without your permission or you are no longer an active user, you can request that we delete your account as provided in this policy. Where you gave us consent to use your information for a limited purpose, you can contact us to withdraw that consent, but this will not affect any processing that has already taken place at the time. You can also opt-out of our use of your information for marketing purposes by contacting us, as provided below. When you make such requests, we may need time to investigate and facilitate your request. If there is a delay or dispute as to whether we have the right to continue using your information, we will restrict any further use of your information until the request is honoured or the dispute is resolved, provided your administrator does not object (where applicable).

Where the Services are made available to you through an organisation (e.g. your employer or that your child attends that institution) that organisation is the administrator of the Services and is responsible for the end-users and/or Service sites over which it has control. If this is the case, please direct your data privacy questions to your administrator, as your use of the Services is subject to that organisation's policies. We are not responsible for the privacy or security practices of an administrator's organisation, which may be different than this policy.Even if the Services are not currently administered to you by an organisation, if you are a member of a team administered by an organisation, or if you use an email address provided by an organisation (such as your work email address) to access the Services, then the administrator of that team or the owner of the domain associated with your organisational email address (e.g. your employer) may assert administrative control over your account and use of the Services at a later date. You will be notified if this happens.Administrators are able to restrict your access to and privileges within your account. In some cases, enterprise administrators can also:require you to reset your account password;restrict, suspend or terminate your access to the Services or your account;control your ability to edit, restrict, modify or delete account information;change your account information, including profile information or the email address associated with your account;access information in and about your account;access or retain information stored as part of your account; andenable or disable third-party apps, or other integrations.If you do not want an administrator to be able to assert control over your account or use of the Services, you should deactivate your membership with the organisation or remove any email addresses containing a domain owned or controlled by the administrator entirely from your account. Once an administrator asserts control over your account or use of the Services, you may no longer be able to withdraw membership or change the email address associated with your account without administrator approval.Please contact your organisation or refer to your administrator\u00e2\u0080\u0099s organisational policies for more information.Our policy towards childrenKinteract is designed for students to take ownership of their digital portfolio and facilitate student directed learning.

A Flash cookie (or locally shared object) is a data file placed on a Device via the Adobe Flash plug-in that may be built-in to or downloaded by you to your Device. HTML5 cookies can be programmed through HTML5 local storage. Unlike Flash cookies, HTML5 cookies do not require a plug-in. Regular cookies may generally be disabled or removed by tools that are available as part of most commercial browsers, and in some but not all instances can be blocked in the future by selecting certain settings. Each browser you use will need to be set separately and different browsers offer different functionality and options in this regard. Also, these tools may not be effective with regard to Flash cookies or HTML5 cookies. For information on disabling Flash cookies go to Adobe's web site www.adobe.com.

Profile information is used by us primarily to be presented back to and edited by you when you access the Service and to be presented to others permitted to view that information on the Service. In some cases (e.g., posting to your page), other users of the Service may be able to supplement your profile. We may offer users the ability to manage their public profile and use profile preference settings as explained where profile features are offered, the functionality and features of which are subject to change from time-to-time so visit it frequently to confirm the settings reflect your then current preferences. Changing setting options may not result in immediate changes to the settings, which are subject to our operations and maintenance schedules. Users should carefully consider the use of such settings to improve information display options and to ensure the settings are properly set and functioning in the manner desired. Notwithstanding the availability of profile preference settings, you should be aware that these settings are for convenience only, and may not be error free. Further, other users that have access may repost or otherwise make public your information or content. Accordingly, discretion and good judgment should be exercised when posting information or content as part of your profile. We recommend that you do not post information or content as part of your profile that you are not prepared to make public.Do Third-Party Content, Links to Third-Party Site(s), and/or Third-Party Apps Appear on the Service.The Service may contain content that is supplied by a third party, and those third parties may collect Usage Information and your Device Identifier when pages from the Service are served to you. In addition, when you are on the Service you may be directed to other sites that are operated and controlled by third parties that we do not control. We are not responsible for the data collection and privacy practices employed by any of these third parties or their services and they may be tracking you across multiple sites and may be sharing the results of that tracking with us and/or other sites. For example, if you \"click\" on a link, the \"click\" may take you off the Service onto a different site. These other sites may associate their Tracking Technologies with you, independently collect data about you, including Personal Information, and may or may not have their own published privacy policies.Third-party applications may also be available via the Service. The owners of these applications may collect Personal Information and other data from you and may have their own policies and practices. We are not responsible for how these third parties or their applications collect or use your information and they may be tracking you across multiple sites and may be sharing the results of that tracking with us and/or others. These third parties may have their own terms of service, privacy policies or other policies and ask you to agree to the same. We are not responsible for these third-party privacy policies or the practices of these third parties. Be sure to review any available policies before submitting any personally identifiable information to a third-party application or otherwise interacting with it and exercise caution in connection with these applications. We also encourage you to note when you leave our Service and to review the third-party privacy policies of all third-party locations and exercise caution in connection with them.Ads and Information About You.The Service may use third parties such as network advertisers and ad exchanges to serve advertisements on and off of the Service and may use third-party analytics and other service providers to evaluate and provide us and/or third parties with information about the use of the Service and viewing of ads and of our content. Network advertisers are third parties that display advertisements based on your visits and activities across the Internet and mobile media (\"Behavioral Ads\"). In addition, we may serve ads on our Service based on your Usage Information from your activities on our Service (\"Contextual Ads\"). Behavioral Ads and Contextual Ads enable us to target advertisements to you for products and services in which you might be interested. If you object to Contextual Ads, do not use our Service. If you object to Behavioral Ads, you can learn more about your ability to limit Behavioral Ads below.Our third-party ad network and exchange providers, advertisers, sponsors and/or traffic measurement services may themselves set and access their own cookies (including Flash cookies), web beacons and other Tracking Technologies on your Device and track certain behavioral Usage Information regarding users of your Device via a Device Identifier. These third-party Tracking Technologies may be set to, among other things: (a) help deliver advertisements to you that you might be interested in; (b) prevent you from seeing the same advertisements too many times; and (c) understand the usefulness to you of the advertisements that have been delivered to you. You acknowledge and agree that associated technology may access and use your Device and may set or change settings on your Device in connection with the associated operations. Note that any images (or any other parts of content) served by third parties in association with third-party ads or other content may serve as web beacons, which enable third parties to carry out the previously described activities.Third-party Tracking Technologies are not controlled by us, even if they are used to serve our ads or interact with our Service. Statements regarding our practices do not apply to the methods for collecting information used by these third parties or the use of the information that such third parties collect. We do however work with third parties to make efforts to have you provided with information on their practices and any available opportunity to exercise choice. The relevant third party's terms of service, privacy policy, permissions, notices and choices should be reviewed regarding their collection, storage and sharing practices. We make no representations regarding the policies or practices of third-party advertisers or advertising networks or exchanges or related third parties.Some third parties we work with may offer you certain choices regarding their practices, and information we have been informed of regarding such choices is available here. Further, while we and third party sites that display our ads may use a variety of companies to serve advertisements, you may wish to visit http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp, which provides information regarding this practice by Network Advertising Initiative (\"NAI\") members, and your choices regarding having this information used by these companies, including the \"opt-out\" procedures of NAI members. Opting out of one or more NAI members only means that those NAI members no longer will be allowed under their own rules to deliver Behavioral Ads to you, which will affect this and other sites, but does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content and/or ads. Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit this opt-out page, or you subsequently erase your cookies, use a different Device or change web browsers, your NAI opt-out may not, or may no longer, be effective. Therefore, if you use multiple Devices or multiple browsers on a single Device, you need to opt-out for each browser that you use on your Device. Additionally, if you delete your cookies, change browsers, or use a different Device, you will need to opt-out again. Additional information is available on the NAI's web site accessible by the above link. Where we serve third-party Behavioral Ads on the Service we participate in the notice and opt-out program run by the Digital Advertising Alliance (\"DAA\"), and you can learn more about it and the opt-out choices it offers at http://www.aboutads.info/choices/#completed. Where we serve our own Behavioral Ads on third party sites, we request that they comply with the DAA program so that you have the same notice and opt-out choice. Please note that similar limitations as described regarding NAI opt-out may apply to the DAA opt-out. Similar limitations may apply to these opt-out methods. We are not responsible for effectiveness of, or compliance with, any third-parties' opt-out options or programs.How Do I Change My Information and Communications Preferences.You are responsible for maintaining the accuracy of the information you submit to us, such as your contact information provided as part of registration. The Service may allow you to review, correct or update Personal Information you have provided through the Service's registration forms or otherwise, and you may provide registration updates and changes, and otherwise request access to your information, by contacting us at privacy@hmhco.com. If so, we will make good faith efforts to make requested changes in our then active databases as soon as reasonably practicable. With respect to our mobile and other applications (i.e., when we are the application publisher), you can prospectively stop all collection of information by the application by uninstalling the application. You may use the standard uninstall process as may be available as part of your applicable Device or potentially via the appropriate application or app marketplace. Please note that it is not always possible to completely remove or delete all of your information from our databases and that residual data may remain on backup media or for other reasons. Also, if you have made any public postings on the Service such as in forums or blogs, these communications cannot generally be removed. When you edit your Personal Information or change your preferences on the Service, information that you remove may persist internally for our administrative purposes. You may cancel or modify our e-mail marketing communications you receive from us by following the instructions contained within our promotional e-mails or in some cases by logging into your account and changing your communication preferences. This will not affect subsequent subscriptions and if your opt-out is limited to certain types of e-mails the opt-out will be so limited. To the extent permitted by applicable law, we reserve the right to send you certain communications relating to your Account or use of our Service, such as administrative and service announcements and, except as prescribed by applicable law, these transactional Account messages may be unaffected if you choose to opt-out from receiving our marketing communications.

We do not use the Service to knowingly collect Personal Information from children under the age of thirteen (13) without verified parental consent or as otherwise permitted by applicable law. Furthermore, most of the portions of our Service that are directed to children 12 years and under are designed so that we do not collect Personal Information at all. In the event any of the Services designed for children 12 years and under, or designed for both such children and older users, do have aspects where we may collect Personal information we will comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (\"COPPA\"), including its verified parental consent requirements. In addition, we will post a separate Children's Privacy Policy on such portions of the Services that explains further what types of Personal information may be collected, under what circumstances, for what purposes and what options parents have to approve or limit such collection.In the event that we become aware that we have collected Personal Information from any child absent the parental consent required by COPPA, or as otherwise permitted by COPPA, we will dispose of that information in accordance with applicable law. If you are a parent or guardian and you believe that your child under the age of 13 has provided us with information without your consent, please contact us at privacy@hmhco.com and we will take reasonable steps to ensure that such information is deleted from our files.What About Security.We incorporate commercially reasonable technical, physical and administrative safeguards to help protect and secure your Personal Information in our custody or control.

Any changes will be effective immediately upon the posting of the revised Privacy Policy and your use of the Service indicates your consent to the privacy policy posted at the time of use. However, we will not use your previously-collected Personal Information in a manner materially different than represented at the time it was collected without your consent.

We may collect this information through various forms and in various places on the Service, including account registration forms, contact us forms, at checkout when ordering products, or when you otherwise interact with the Service. To the extent we combine the non-personally identifiable Demographic Information with the Personal Information we collect directly from you on the Service, we will treat the combined data as Personal Information under this Privacy Policy.Information We Collect or Store As You Access and Use the Service.In addition to any Personal Information or other information that you choose to submit to us via our Service, we and our third-party service providers may use a variety of technologies that automatically (or passively) collect or store certain information when you visit or interact with the Service (\"Usage Information\"). This Usage Information may be stored or accessed using a variety of technologies that may be downloaded to your personal computer, laptop, tablet or mobile phone (a \"Device\") when you visit or interact with our Service. Usage Information may be non identifying or may be associated with you. To the extent we associate Usage Information with your Personal Information, we will treat it as Personal Information.This Usage Information may include:.your IP address, UDID or another unique identifier (\"Device Identifier\"). A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to your Device used to access the Service, and our computers identify your Device by its Device Identifier;.your Device functionality (including browser, operating system, hardware, mobile network information);.the URL that referred you to our Service;.the areas within our Service that you visit and your activities there, including remembering you and your preferences;.your Device location;.your Device characteristics; and.certain other Device data, including the time of day, among other information.We may use various methods and technologies to collect or store Usage Information (\"Tracking Technologies\"). Tracking Technologies may set, change, alter or modify settings or configurations on your Device. A few of the Tracking Technologies include, without limitation, the following (and subsequent technology and methods later developed):.Cookies. A cookie is a data file placed on a Device when it is used to visit the Service. A Flash cookie (or locally shared object) is a data file placed on a Device via the Adobe Flash plug-in that may be built-in to or downloaded by you to your Device. HTML5 cookies can be programmed through HTML5 local storage. Unlike Flash cookies, HTML5 cookies do not require a plug-in. Regular cookies may generally be disabled or removed by tools that are available as part of most commercial browsers, and in some but not all instances can be blocked in the future by selecting certain settings. Each browser you use will need to be set separately and different browsers offer different functionality and options in this regard. Also, these tools may not be effective with regard to Flash cookies or HTML5 cookies. For information on disabling Flash cookies go to Adobe's web site www.adobe.com. Please be aware that if you disable or remove cookies, Flash cookies, or HTML5 cookies on your Device, some parts of our Service may not function properly, and that when you revisit our Service your ability to limit cookies is subject to your browser settings and limitations.Web Beacons. Small graphic images or other web programming code called web beacons (also known as \"1x1 GIFs\" or \"clear GIFs\") may be included in our Service's pages and messages. Web beacons may be invisible to you, but any electronic image or other web programming code inserted into a page or e-mail can act as a web beacon. Web beacons or similar technologies may be used for a number of purposes, including, without limitation, to count visitors to the Service, to monitor how users navigate the Service, to count how many e-mails that were sent were actually opened or to count how many particular articles or links were actually viewed.Embedded Scripts. An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the Service, such as the links you click on. The code is temporarily downloaded onto your Device from our web server or a third-party service provider, is active only while you are connected to the Service, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter.ETag, or entity tag. A feature of the cache in browsers. It is an opaque identifier assigned by a web server to a specific version of a resource found at a URL. If the resource content at that URL ever changes, a new and different ETag is assigned. Used in this manner ETags are a form of Device Identifier. ETag tracking may generate unique tracking values even where the consumer blocks HTTP, Flash, and/or HTML5 cookies.For information on why and how we use Tracking Technologies, see below.Information Third Parties Provide About You.We may receive information about you from your friends, colleagues and others that use the Service, such as when they submit content to us or post on the Service. Additionally, we may, from time to time, supplement the information we collect directly from you on our Service with outside records from third parties. We do this for various purposes, including to enhance our ability to serve you, to tailor our content to you and to offer you opportunities that may be of interest to you. To the extent we combine any information we receive from those sources with Personal Information we collect on the Service, it will be treated as Personal Information and we will apply this Privacy Policy to such combined information, unless we have disclosed otherwise. In no other circumstances do our obligations under this Privacy Policy apply to information we receive about you from third parties.Interactions with Third-Party Sites.The Service may include functionality that allows certain kinds of interactions between the Service and your account on a third-party web site or application. The use of this functionality may involve the third-party operator providing certain information, including Personal Information, to us. For example, when you register with the Service, you may have an option to use your Facebook, Google or other account information provided by a third-party site or application to facilitate the registration and log-in or transaction process on the Service, or otherwise link accounts. If we offer and you choose to use this functionality to access our Service, the third-party site or application may send Personal Information about you to the Service. If so, we will then treat it as Personal Information under this Privacy Policy, since we are collecting it as a result of your accessing of and interaction on our Service. In addition, we may provide third-party sites' interfaces or links on the Service to facilitate your sending a communication from the Service. For example, we may use third parties to facilitate emails, tweets or Facebook postings. These third parties may retain any information used or provided in any such communications or other activities and these third parties' practices are not subject to our Privacy Policy. We may not control or have access to your communications through these third parties. Further, when you use third-party sites or services, you are using their services and not our services and they, not we, are responsible for their practices. You should review the applicable third-party privacy policies before using such third-party tools on our Service.Information You Provide About a Third Party.You may send someone else a communication from the Service, such as sending an invitation to a friend or family member.

This may include using third-party tools such as Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, Google+ or other third-party posting or content sharing tools. We are not responsible for the privacy policies and practices of such third parties and, therefore, you should review such third-party privacy policies and practices of such third parties prior to requesting information from or otherwise interacting with them.Third Parties Providing Services on Our Behalf.We may use third-party vendors to perform certain services on behalf of us or the Service, such as hosting the Service, designing and/or operating the Service's features, tracking the Service's activities and analytics, and enabling us to send you special offers or perform other administrative services. This may include content provided or operated by, in whole or in part, third parties. We may provide these vendors with access to user information, including Device Identifiers and Personal Information, to carry out the services they are performing for you or for us. However, we require them to safeguard your Personal Information and not to use your Personal Information for their own purposes without your express consent. In addition, third-party analytics service and other providers may set and access their own Tracking Technologies on your Device and they may otherwise collect or have access to your personal Information.

We reserve the right to disclose and transfer all such information: (i) to a subsequent owner, co-owner or operator of the Service or applicable database; or (ii) in connection with a merger, consolidation, restructuring, the sale of substantially all of our interests and/or assets or other corporate change, including, during the course of any due diligence process.Co-Branded Areas.Certain areas of the Service may be provided to you in association with third parties (\"Co-Branded Areas\") such as sponsors, schools and educational organizations and may require you to disclose Personal Information to them. Such Co-Branded Areas will identify the third party and indicate if they have a privacy policy that applies to their collection and use of you information. If you elect to register for products and/or services, communicate with such third parties or download their content or applications, at Co-Branded Areas, you may be providing your information to both us and the third party. Further, if you sign-in to a Co-Branded Area with a username and password obtained on the Service, your Personal Information may be disclosed to the identified third parties for that Co-Branded Area.

Additionally, the Service may permit you to submit and/or publicly post ideas, photographs, lessons, lectures, writings, music, video, audio recordings, computer graphics, pictures, data, questions, comments, suggestions or other content, including Personal Information (collectively, \"User Content\"), such as on a profile page, blogs and message boards. We or others may store, display, reproduce, publish, distribute or otherwise use User Content online or offline in any media or format (currently existing or hereafter developed) and may or may not attribute it to you. Others may have access to this User Content and may have the ability to share it with third parties. Postings to chat rooms, message boards, other user's profiles, bulletin boards, or similar public forums where you and other users of our Service can communicate are public or semi-public, and therefore may be reviewed by users and non-users, indexed by third-party search engines and appear in search results on third-party web sites. Accordingly, you should exercise discretion and good judgment regarding what you elect to include as User Content.

We are not responsible for the accuracy, use or misuse of any User Content that you disclose or receive from third parties through the Service.Name and Likeness.We may also publish your name, voice, likeness and other Personal Information that is part of your User Content, and we may use the content, or any portion of the content, for advertising, marketing, publicity and promotional activities. For full terms and conditions regarding User Content you submit to the Service, please review our Terms of Use.Profiles.We may provide features that allow users to create a profile. A user's profile page may be, by default, set up to display information such as the user's display name, images, location (city/state/country), groups that the user has joined and optional information added by the user including, for example, the user's tagline, photographs and educational materials, etc. We may make it possible for users to see a report on other users that visited a profile page and this gives users access to such visitor's profile pages. Profile information is used by us primarily to be presented back to and edited by you when you access the Service and to be presented to others permitted to view that information on the Service. In some cases (e.g., posting to your page), other users of the Service may be able to supplement your profile. We may offer users the ability to manage their public profile and use profile preference settings as explained where profile features are offered, the functionality and features of which are subject to change from time-to-time so visit it frequently to confirm the settings reflect your then current preferences. Changing setting options may not result in immediate changes to the settings, which are subject to our operations and maintenance schedules. Users should carefully consider the use of such settings to improve information display options and to ensure the settings are properly set and functioning in the manner desired. Notwithstanding the availability of profile preference settings, you should be aware that these settings are for convenience only, and may not be error free. Further, other users that have access may repost or otherwise make public your information or content. Accordingly, discretion and good judgment should be exercised when posting information or content as part of your profile. We recommend that you do not post information or content as part of your profile that you are not prepared to make public.Do Third-Party Content, Links to Third-Party Site(s), and/or Third-Party Apps Appear on the Service.The Service may contain content that is supplied by a third party, and those third parties may collect Usage Information and your Device Identifier when pages from the Service are served to you. In addition, when you are on the Service you may be directed to other sites that are operated and controlled by third parties that we do not control. We are not responsible for the data collection and privacy practices employed by any of these third parties or their services and they may be tracking you across multiple sites and may be sharing the results of that tracking with us and/or other sites. For example, if you \"click\" on a link, the \"click\" may take you off the Service onto a different site. These other sites may associate their Tracking Technologies with you, independently collect data about you, including Personal Information, and may or may not have their own published privacy policies.Third-party applications may also be available via the Service. The owners of these applications may collect Personal Information and other data from you and may have their own policies and practices. We are not responsible for how these third parties or their applications collect or use your information and they may be tracking you across multiple sites and may be sharing the results of that tracking with us and/or others. These third parties may have their own terms of service, privacy policies or other policies and ask you to agree to the same. We are not responsible for these third-party privacy policies or the practices of these third parties. Be sure to review any available policies before submitting any personally identifiable information to a third-party application or otherwise interacting with it and exercise caution in connection with these applications. We also encourage you to note when you leave our Service and to review the third-party privacy policies of all third-party locations and exercise caution in connection with them.Ads and Information About You.The Service may use third parties such as network advertisers and ad exchanges to serve advertisements on and off of the Service and may use third-party analytics and other service providers to evaluate and provide us and/or third parties with information about the use of the Service and viewing of ads and of our content. Network advertisers are third parties that display advertisements based on your visits and activities across the Internet and mobile media (\"Behavioral Ads\"). In addition, we may serve ads on our Service based on your Usage Information from your activities on our Service (\"Contextual Ads\"). Behavioral Ads and Contextual Ads enable us to target advertisements to you for products and services in which you might be interested. If you object to Contextual Ads, do not use our Service. If you object to Behavioral Ads, you can learn more about your ability to limit Behavioral Ads below.Our third-party ad network and exchange providers, advertisers, sponsors and/or traffic measurement services may themselves set and access their own cookies (including Flash cookies), web beacons and other Tracking Technologies on your Device and track certain behavioral Usage Information regarding users of your Device via a Device Identifier. These third-party Tracking Technologies may be set to, among other things: (a) help deliver advertisements to you that you might be interested in; (b) prevent you from seeing the same advertisements too many times; and (c) understand the usefulness to you of the advertisements that have been delivered to you. You acknowledge and agree that associated technology may access and use your Device and may set or change settings on your Device in connection with the associated operations. Note that any images (or any other parts of content) served by third parties in association with third-party ads or other content may serve as web beacons, which enable third parties to carry out the previously described activities.Third-party Tracking Technologies are not controlled by us, even if they are used to serve our ads or interact with our Service. Statements regarding our practices do not apply to the methods for collecting information used by these third parties or the use of the information that such third parties collect. We do however work with third parties to make efforts to have you provided with information on their practices and any available opportunity to exercise choice. The relevant third party's terms of service, privacy policy, permissions, notices and choices should be reviewed regarding their collection, storage and sharing practices. We make no representations regarding the policies or practices of third-party advertisers or advertising networks or exchanges or related third parties.Some third parties we work with may offer you certain choices regarding their practices, and information we have been informed of regarding such choices is available here. Further, while we and third party sites that display our ads may use a variety of companies to serve advertisements, you may wish to visit http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp, which provides information regarding this practice by Network Advertising Initiative (\"NAI\") members, and your choices regarding having this information used by these companies, including the \"opt-out\" procedures of NAI members. Opting out of one or more NAI members only means that those NAI members no longer will be allowed under their own rules to deliver Behavioral Ads to you, which will affect this and other sites, but does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content and/or ads. Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit this opt-out page, or you subsequently erase your cookies, use a different Device or change web browsers, your NAI opt-out may not, or may no longer, be effective. Therefore, if you use multiple Devices or multiple browsers on a single Device, you need to opt-out for each browser that you use on your Device. Additionally, if you delete your cookies, change browsers, or use a different Device, you will need to opt-out again. Additional information is available on the NAI's web site accessible by the above link. Where we serve third-party Behavioral Ads on the Service we participate in the notice and opt-out program run by the Digital Advertising Alliance (\"DAA\"), and you can learn more about it and the opt-out choices it offers at http://www.aboutads.info/choices/#completed. Where we serve our own Behavioral Ads on third party sites, we request that they comply with the DAA program so that you have the same notice and opt-out choice. Please note that similar limitations as described regarding NAI opt-out may apply to the DAA opt-out. Similar limitations may apply to these opt-out methods. We are not responsible for effectiveness of, or compliance with, any third-parties' opt-out options or programs.How Do I Change My Information and Communications Preferences.You are responsible for maintaining the accuracy of the information you submit to us, such as your contact information provided as part of registration. The Service may allow you to review, correct or update Personal Information you have provided through the Service's registration forms or otherwise, and you may provide registration updates and changes, and otherwise request access to your information, by contacting us at privacy@hmhco.com. If so, we will make good faith efforts to make requested changes in our then active databases as soon as reasonably practicable. With respect to our mobile and other applications (i.e., when we are the application publisher), you can prospectively stop all collection of information by the application by uninstalling the application. You may use the standard uninstall process as may be available as part of your applicable Device or potentially via the appropriate application or app marketplace. Please note that it is not always possible to completely remove or delete all of your information from our databases and that residual data may remain on backup media or for other reasons. Also, if you have made any public postings on the Service such as in forums or blogs, these communications cannot generally be removed. When you edit your Personal Information or change your preferences on the Service, information that you remove may persist internally for our administrative purposes. You may cancel or modify our e-mail marketing communications you receive from us by following the instructions contained within our promotional e-mails or in some cases by logging into your account and changing your communication preferences. This will not affect subsequent subscriptions and if your opt-out is limited to certain types of e-mails the opt-out will be so limited. To the extent permitted by applicable law, we reserve the right to send you certain communications relating to your Account or use of our Service, such as administrative and service announcements and, except as prescribed by applicable law, these transactional Account messages may be unaffected if you choose to opt-out from receiving our marketing communications. If you have any questions about the Privacy Policy or practices described in it, you should contact us by e-mail at: privacy@hmhco.com.What Should Parents Know About Children.We understand the importance of protecting children's privacy in the interactive world. We do not use the Service to knowingly collect Personal Information from children under the age of thirteen (13) without verified parental consent or as otherwise permitted by applicable law. Furthermore, most of the portions of our Service that are directed to children 12 years and under are designed so that we do not collect Personal Information at all. In the event any of the Services designed for children 12 years and under, or designed for both such children and older users, do have aspects where we may collect Personal information we will comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (\"COPPA\"), including its verified parental consent requirements. In addition, we will post a separate Children's Privacy Policy on such portions of the Services that explains further what types of Personal information may be collected, under what circumstances, for what purposes and what options parents have to approve or limit such collection.In the event that we become aware that we have collected Personal Information from any child absent the parental consent required by COPPA, or as otherwise permitted by COPPA, we will dispose of that information in accordance with applicable law. If you are a parent or guardian and you believe that your child under the age of 13 has provided us with information without your consent, please contact us at privacy@hmhco.com and we will take reasonable steps to ensure that such information is deleted from our files.What About Security.We incorporate commercially reasonable technical, physical and administrative safeguards to help protect and secure your Personal Information in our custody or control. However, no data transmission over the Internet, mobile networks, wireless transmission or electronic storage of information can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Please note that we cannot ensure the security of any information you transmit to us, and you use our Service and provide us with your information at your own risk.What About Changes To The Privacy Policy.We reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time without notice to you. Any changes will be effective immediately upon the posting of the revised Privacy Policy and your use of the Service indicates your consent to the privacy policy posted at the time of use. However, we will not use your previously-collected Personal Information in a manner materially different than represented at the time it was collected without your consent. To the extent any provision of this Privacy Policy is found by a competent tribunal to be invalid or unenforceable, such provision shall be severed to the extent necessary for the remainder to be valid and enforceable.Who Can I Contact.If you have questions, comments or complaints regarding our Privacy Policy or the manner in which we or our service providers treat your Personal Information, or to access, correct or update Personal Information in our records, contact us at: privacy@hmhco.com.The following third parties that collect information from you on our Service have given us notice that you may obtain information on their policies and practices, and in some instances opt-out of certain of their activities, as follows:.Party Service Privacy Choices and More Information Use of Tracking Technologies.Adobe Online Marketing Services, On Demand Services and/or other Adobe-hosted services.http://www.adobe.com/privacy/hosted-services.html.http://www.adobe.com/privacy/other-policies.html.Yes.Google Google Analytics for Display Advertisers, Ads Preferences Manager, and Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on.http://support.google.com/analytics/bin/answer.py.hl=en&topic=2611283&answer=2700409.http://www.google.com/settings/ads/onweb/.hl=en&sig=ACi0TCg8VN3Fad5_pDOsAS8a4\u2026.https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/.Yes.NOTE: We are not responsible for third-party policies or practices.

A few of the Tracking Technologies include, without limitation, the following (and subsequent technology and methods later developed):.Cookies. A cookie is a data file placed on a Device when it is used to visit the Service. A Flash cookie (or locally shared object) is a data file placed on a Device via the Adobe Flash plug-in that may be built-in to or downloaded by you to your Device. HTML5 cookies can be programmed through HTML5 local storage. Unlike Flash cookies, HTML5 cookies do not require a plug-in. Regular cookies may generally be disabled or removed by tools that are available as part of most commercial browsers, and in some but not all instances can be blocked in the future by selecting certain settings. Each browser you use will need to be set separately and different browsers offer different functionality and options in this regard. Also, these tools may not be effective with regard to Flash cookies or HTML5 cookies. For information on disabling Flash cookies go to Adobe's web site www.adobe.com. Please be aware that if you disable or remove cookies, Flash cookies, or HTML5 cookies on your Device, some parts of our Service may not function properly, and that when you revisit our Service your ability to limit cookies is subject to your browser settings and limitations.Web Beacons. Small graphic images or other web programming code called web beacons (also known as \"1x1 GIFs\" or \"clear GIFs\") may be included in our Service's pages and messages. Web beacons may be invisible to you, but any electronic image or other web programming code inserted into a page or e-mail can act as a web beacon. Web beacons or similar technologies may be used for a number of purposes, including, without limitation, to count visitors to the Service, to monitor how users navigate the Service, to count how many e-mails that were sent were actually opened or to count how many particular articles or links were actually viewed.Embedded Scripts. An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the Service, such as the links you click on. The code is temporarily downloaded onto your Device from our web server or a third-party service provider, is active only while you are connected to the Service, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter.ETag, or entity tag. A feature of the cache in browsers. It is an opaque identifier assigned by a web server to a specific version of a resource found at a URL. If the resource content at that URL ever changes, a new and different ETag is assigned. Used in this manner ETags are a form of Device Identifier. ETag tracking may generate unique tracking values even where the consumer blocks HTTP, Flash, and/or HTML5 cookies.For information on why and how we use Tracking Technologies, see below.Information Third Parties Provide About You.We may receive information about you from your friends, colleagues and others that use the Service, such as when they submit content to us or post on the Service.

We do this for various purposes, including to enhance our ability to serve you, to tailor our content to you and to offer you opportunities that may be of interest to you. To the extent we combine any information we receive from those sources with Personal Information we collect on the Service, it will be treated as Personal Information and we will apply this Privacy Policy to such combined information, unless we have disclosed otherwise.

Profile information is used by us primarily to be presented back to and edited by you when you access the Service and to be presented to others permitted to view that information on the Service. In some cases (e.g., posting to your page), other users of the Service may be able to supplement your profile.

Users should carefully consider the use of such settings to improve information display options and to ensure the settings are properly set and functioning in the manner desired. Notwithstanding the availability of profile preference settings, you should be aware that these settings are for convenience only, and may not be error free. Further, other users that have access may repost or otherwise make public your information or content.

We are not responsible for the data collection and privacy practices employed by any of these third parties or their services and they may be tracking you across multiple sites and may be sharing the results of that tracking with us and/or other sites. For example, if you \"click\" on a link, the \"click\" may take you off the Service onto a different site. These other sites may associate their Tracking Technologies with you, independently collect data about you, including Personal Information, and may or may not have their own published privacy policies.Third-party applications may also be available via the Service. The owners of these applications may collect Personal Information and other data from you and may have their own policies and practices. We are not responsible for how these third parties or their applications collect or use your information and they may be tracking you across multiple sites and may be sharing the results of that tracking with us and/or others. These third parties may have their own terms of service, privacy policies or other policies and ask you to agree to the same. We are not responsible for these third-party privacy policies or the practices of these third parties. Be sure to review any available policies before submitting any personally identifiable information to a third-party application or otherwise interacting with it and exercise caution in connection with these applications. We also encourage you to note when you leave our Service and to review the third-party privacy policies of all third-party locations and exercise caution in connection with them.Ads and Information About You.The Service may use third parties such as network advertisers and ad exchanges to serve advertisements on and off of the Service and may use third-party analytics and other service providers to evaluate and provide us and/or third parties with information about the use of the Service and viewing of ads and of our content. Network advertisers are third parties that display advertisements based on your visits and activities across the Internet and mobile media (\"Behavioral Ads\"). In addition, we may serve ads on our Service based on your Usage Information from your activities on our Service (\"Contextual Ads\"). Behavioral Ads and Contextual Ads enable us to target advertisements to you for products and services in which you might be interested. If you object to Contextual Ads, do not use our Service. If you object to Behavioral Ads, you can learn more about your ability to limit Behavioral Ads below.Our third-party ad network and exchange providers, advertisers, sponsors and/or traffic measurement services may themselves set and access their own cookies (including Flash cookies), web beacons and other Tracking Technologies on your Device and track certain behavioral Usage Information regarding users of your Device via a Device Identifier. These third-party Tracking Technologies may be set to, among other things: (a) help deliver advertisements to you that you might be interested in; (b) prevent you from seeing the same advertisements too many times; and (c) understand the usefulness to you of the advertisements that have been delivered to you. You acknowledge and agree that associated technology may access and use your Device and may set or change settings on your Device in connection with the associated operations. Note that any images (or any other parts of content) served by third parties in association with third-party ads or other content may serve as web beacons, which enable third parties to carry out the previously described activities.Third-party Tracking Technologies are not controlled by us, even if they are used to serve our ads or interact with our Service. Statements regarding our practices do not apply to the methods for collecting information used by these third parties or the use of the information that such third parties collect. We do however work with third parties to make efforts to have you provided with information on their practices and any available opportunity to exercise choice. The relevant third party's terms of service, privacy policy, permissions, notices and choices should be reviewed regarding their collection, storage and sharing practices. We make no representations regarding the policies or practices of third-party advertisers or advertising networks or exchanges or related third parties.Some third parties we work with may offer you certain choices regarding their practices, and information we have been informed of regarding such choices is available here. Further, while we and third party sites that display our ads may use a variety of companies to serve advertisements, you may wish to visit http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp, which provides information regarding this practice by Network Advertising Initiative (\"NAI\") members, and your choices regarding having this information used by these companies, including the \"opt-out\" procedures of NAI members. Opting out of one or more NAI members only means that those NAI members no longer will be allowed under their own rules to deliver Behavioral Ads to you, which will affect this and other sites, but does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content and/or ads. Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit this opt-out page, or you subsequently erase your cookies, use a different Device or change web browsers, your NAI opt-out may not, or may no longer, be effective. Therefore, if you use multiple Devices or multiple browsers on a single Device, you need to opt-out for each browser that you use on your Device. Additionally, if you delete your cookies, change browsers, or use a different Device, you will need to opt-out again.

We do not use the Service to knowingly collect Personal Information from children under the age of thirteen (13) without verified parental consent or as otherwise permitted by applicable law.

In the event any of the Services designed for children 12 years and under, or designed for both such children and older users, do have aspects where we may collect Personal information we will comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (\"COPPA\"), including its verified parental consent requirements. In addition, we will post a separate Children's Privacy Policy on such portions of the Services that explains further what types of Personal information may be collected, under what circumstances, for what purposes and what options parents have to approve or limit such collection.In the event that we become aware that we have collected Personal Information from any child absent the parental consent required by COPPA, or as otherwise permitted by COPPA, we will dispose of that information in accordance with applicable law. If you are a parent or guardian and you believe that your child under the age of 13 has provided us with information without your consent, please contact us at privacy@hmhco.com and we will take reasonable steps to ensure that such information is deleted from our files.What About Security.We incorporate commercially reasonable technical, physical and administrative safeguards to help protect and secure your Personal Information in our custody or control. However, no data transmission over the Internet, mobile networks, wireless transmission or electronic storage of information can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Please note that we cannot ensure the security of any information you transmit to us, and you use our Service and provide us with your information at your own risk.What About Changes To The Privacy Policy.We reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time without notice to you. Any changes will be effective immediately upon the posting of the revised Privacy Policy and your use of the Service indicates your consent to the privacy policy posted at the time of use. However, we will not use your previously-collected Personal Information in a manner materially different than represented at the time it was collected without your consent. To the extent any provision of this Privacy Policy is found by a competent tribunal to be invalid or unenforceable, such provision shall be severed to the extent necessary for the remainder to be valid and enforceable.Who Can I Contact.If you have questions, comments or complaints regarding our Privacy Policy or the manner in which we or our service providers treat your Personal Information, or to access, correct or update Personal Information in our records, contact us at: privacy@hmhco.com.The following third parties that collect information from you on our Service have given us notice that you may obtain information on their policies and practices, and in some instances opt-out of certain of their activities, as follows:.Party Service Privacy Choices and More Information Use of Tracking Technologies.Adobe Online Marketing Services, On Demand Services and/or other Adobe-hosted services.http://www.adobe.com/privacy/hosted-services.html.http://www.adobe.com/privacy/other-policies.html.Yes.Google Google Analytics for Display Advertisers, Ads Preferences Manager, and Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on.http://support.google.com/analytics/bin/answer.py.hl=en&topic=2611283&answer=2700409.http://www.google.com/settings/ads/onweb/.hl=en&sig=ACi0TCg8VN3Fad5_pDOsAS8a4\u2026.https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/.Yes.NOTE: We are not responsible for third-party policies or practices.

Profile information is used by us primarily to be presented back to and edited by you when you access the Service and to be presented to others permitted to view that information on the Service. In some cases (e.g., posting to your page), other users of the Service may be able to supplement your profile. We may offer users the ability to manage their public profile and use profile preference settings as explained where profile features are offered, the functionality and features of which are subject to change from time-to-time so visit it frequently to confirm the settings reflect your then current preferences. Changing setting options may not result in immediate changes to the settings, which are subject to our operations and maintenance schedules. Users should carefully consider the use of such settings to improve information display options and to ensure the settings are properly set and functioning in the manner desired. Notwithstanding the availability of profile preference settings, you should be aware that these settings are for convenience only, and may not be error free. Further, other users that have access may repost or otherwise make public your information or content. Accordingly, discretion and good judgment should be exercised when posting information or content as part of your profile. We recommend that you do not post information or content as part of your profile that you are not prepared to make public.Do Third-Party Content, Links to Third-Party Site(s), and/or Third-Party Apps Appear on the Service.The Service may contain content that is supplied by a third party, and those third parties may collect Usage Information and your Device Identifier when pages from the Service are served to you. In addition, when you are on the Service you may be directed to other sites that are operated and controlled by third parties that we do not control. We are not responsible for the data collection and privacy practices employed by any of these third parties or their services and they may be tracking you across multiple sites and may be sharing the results of that tracking with us and/or other sites. For example, if you \"click\" on a link, the \"click\" may take you off the Service onto a different site. These other sites may associate their Tracking Technologies with you, independently collect data about you, including Personal Information, and may or may not have their own published privacy policies.Third-party applications may also be available via the Service. The owners of these applications may collect Personal Information and other data from you and may have their own policies and practices. We are not responsible for how these third parties or their applications collect or use your information and they may be tracking you across multiple sites and may be sharing the results of that tracking with us and/or others. These third parties may have their own terms of service, privacy policies or other policies and ask you to agree to the same. We are not responsible for these third-party privacy policies or the practices of these third parties. Be sure to review any available policies before submitting any personally identifiable information to a third-party application or otherwise interacting with it and exercise caution in connection with these applications. We also encourage you to note when you leave our Service and to review the third-party privacy policies of all third-party locations and exercise caution in connection with them.Ads and Information About You.The Service may use third parties such as network advertisers and ad exchanges to serve advertisements on and off of the Service and may use third-party analytics and other service providers to evaluate and provide us and/or third parties with information about the use of the Service and viewing of ads and of our content. Network advertisers are third parties that display advertisements based on your visits and activities across the Internet and mobile media (\"Behavioral Ads\"). In addition, we may serve ads on our Service based on your Usage Information from your activities on our Service (\"Contextual Ads\"). Behavioral Ads and Contextual Ads enable us to target advertisements to you for products and services in which you might be interested. If you object to Contextual Ads, do not use our Service. If you object to Behavioral Ads, you can learn more about your ability to limit Behavioral Ads below.Our third-party ad network and exchange providers, advertisers, sponsors and/or traffic measurement services may themselves set and access their own cookies (including Flash cookies), web beacons and other Tracking Technologies on your Device and track certain behavioral Usage Information regarding users of your Device via a Device Identifier. These third-party Tracking Technologies may be set to, among other things: (a) help deliver advertisements to you that you might be interested in; (b) prevent you from seeing the same advertisements too many times; and (c) understand the usefulness to you of the advertisements that have been delivered to you. You acknowledge and agree that associated technology may access and use your Device and may set or change settings on your Device in connection with the associated operations. Note that any images (or any other parts of content) served by third parties in association with third-party ads or other content may serve as web beacons, which enable third parties to carry out the previously described activities.Third-party Tracking Technologies are not controlled by us, even if they are used to serve our ads or interact with our Service. Statements regarding our practices do not apply to the methods for collecting information used by these third parties or the use of the information that such third parties collect. We do however work with third parties to make efforts to have you provided with information on their practices and any available opportunity to exercise choice. The relevant third party's terms of service, privacy policy, permissions, notices and choices should be reviewed regarding their collection, storage and sharing practices. We make no representations regarding the policies or practices of third-party advertisers or advertising networks or exchanges or related third parties.Some third parties we work with may offer you certain choices regarding their practices, and information we have been informed of regarding such choices is available here. Further, while we and third party sites that display our ads may use a variety of companies to serve advertisements, you may wish to visit http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp, which provides information regarding this practice by Network Advertising Initiative (\"NAI\") members, and your choices regarding having this information used by these companies, including the \"opt-out\" procedures of NAI members. Opting out of one or more NAI members only means that those NAI members no longer will be allowed under their own rules to deliver Behavioral Ads to you, which will affect this and other sites, but does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content and/or ads. Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit this opt-out page, or you subsequently erase your cookies, use a different Device or change web browsers, your NAI opt-out may not, or may no longer, be effective. Therefore, if you use multiple Devices or multiple browsers on a single Device, you need to opt-out for each browser that you use on your Device. Additionally, if you delete your cookies, change browsers, or use a different Device, you will need to opt-out again. Additional information is available on the NAI's web site accessible by the above link. Where we serve third-party Behavioral Ads on the Service we participate in the notice and opt-out program run by the Digital Advertising Alliance (\"DAA\"), and you can learn more about it and the opt-out choices it offers at http://www.aboutads.info/choices/#completed. Where we serve our own Behavioral Ads on third party sites, we request that they comply with the DAA program so that you have the same notice and opt-out choice. Please note that similar limitations as described regarding NAI opt-out may apply to the DAA opt-out. Similar limitations may apply to these opt-out methods. We are not responsible for effectiveness of, or compliance with, any third-parties' opt-out options or programs.How Do I Change My Information and Communications Preferences.You are responsible for maintaining the accuracy of the information you submit to us, such as your contact information provided as part of registration. The Service may allow you to review, correct or update Personal Information you have provided through the Service's registration forms or otherwise, and you may provide registration updates and changes, and otherwise request access to your information, by contacting us at privacy@hmhco.com. If so, we will make good faith efforts to make requested changes in our then active databases as soon as reasonably practicable. With respect to our mobile and other applications (i.e., when we are the application publisher), you can prospectively stop all collection of information by the application by uninstalling the application. You may use the standard uninstall process as may be available as part of your applicable Device or potentially via the appropriate application or app marketplace. Please note that it is not always possible to completely remove or delete all of your information from our databases and that residual data may remain on backup media or for other reasons. Also, if you have made any public postings on the Service such as in forums or blogs, these communications cannot generally be removed. When you edit your Personal Information or change your preferences on the Service, information that you remove may persist internally for our administrative purposes. You may cancel or modify our e-mail marketing communications you receive from us by following the instructions contained within our promotional e-mails or in some cases by logging into your account and changing your communication preferences. This will not affect subsequent subscriptions and if your opt-out is limited to certain types of e-mails the opt-out will be so limited. To the extent permitted by applicable law, we reserve the right to send you certain communications relating to your Account or use of our Service, such as administrative and service announcements and, except as prescribed by applicable law, these transactional Account messages may be unaffected if you choose to opt-out from receiving our marketing communications. If you have any questions about the Privacy Policy or practices described in it, you should contact us by e-mail at: privacy@hmhco.com.What Should Parents Know About Children.We understand the importance of protecting children's privacy in the interactive world. We do not use the Service to knowingly collect Personal Information from children under the age of thirteen (13) without verified parental consent or as otherwise permitted by applicable law. Furthermore, most of the portions of our Service that are directed to children 12 years and under are designed so that we do not collect Personal Information at all. In the event any of the Services designed for children 12 years and under, or designed for both such children and older users, do have aspects where we may collect Personal information we will comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (\"COPPA\"), including its verified parental consent requirements. In addition, we will post a separate Children's Privacy Policy on such portions of the Services that explains further what types of Personal information may be collected, under what circumstances, for what purposes and what options parents have to approve or limit such collection.In the event that we become aware that we have collected Personal Information from any child absent the parental consent required by COPPA, or as otherwise permitted by COPPA, we will dispose of that information in accordance with applicable law. If you are a parent or guardian and you believe that your child under the age of 13 has provided us with information without your consent, please contact us at privacy@hmhco.com and we will take reasonable steps to ensure that such information is deleted from our files.What About Security.We incorporate commercially reasonable technical, physical and administrative safeguards to help protect and secure your Personal Information in our custody or control.

Additionally, we may, from time to time, supplement the information we collect directly from you on our Service with outside records from third parties. We do this for various purposes, including to enhance our ability to serve you, to tailor our content to you and to offer you opportunities that may be of interest to you. To the extent we combine any information we receive from those sources with Personal Information we collect on the Service, it will be treated as Personal Information and we will apply this Privacy Policy to such combined information, unless we have disclosed otherwise. In no other circumstances do our obligations under this Privacy Policy apply to information we receive about you from third parties.Interactions with Third-Party Sites.The Service may include functionality that allows certain kinds of interactions between the Service and your account on a third-party web site or application.

For example, when you register with the Service, you may have an option to use your Facebook, Google or other account information provided by a third-party site or application to facilitate the registration and log-in or transaction process on the Service, or otherwise link accounts. If we offer and you choose to use this functionality to access our Service, the third-party site or application may send Personal Information about you to the Service. If so, we will then treat it as Personal Information under this Privacy Policy, since we are collecting it as a result of your accessing of and interaction on our Service. In addition, we may provide third-party sites' interfaces or links on the Service to facilitate your sending a communication from the Service.

Do Third-Party Content, Links to Third-Party Site(s), and/or Third-Party Apps Appear on the Service.The Service may contain content that is supplied by a third party, and those third parties may collect Usage Information and your Device Identifier when pages from the Service are served to you. In addition, when you are on the Service you may be directed to other sites that are operated and controlled by third parties that we do not control. We are not responsible for the data collection and privacy practices employed by any of these third parties or their services and they may be tracking you across multiple sites and may be sharing the results of that tracking with us and/or other sites. For example, if you \"click\" on a link, the \"click\" may take you off the Service onto a different site. These other sites may associate their Tracking Technologies with you, independently collect data about you, including Personal Information, and may or may not have their own published privacy policies.Third-party applications may also be available via the Service. The owners of these applications may collect Personal Information and other data from you and may have their own policies and practices. We are not responsible for how these third parties or their applications collect or use your information and they may be tracking you across multiple sites and may be sharing the results of that tracking with us and/or others. These third parties may have their own terms of service, privacy policies or other policies and ask you to agree to the same. We are not responsible for these third-party privacy policies or the practices of these third parties. Be sure to review any available policies before submitting any personally identifiable information to a third-party application or otherwise interacting with it and exercise caution in connection with these applications. We also encourage you to note when you leave our Service and to review the third-party privacy policies of all third-party locations and exercise caution in connection with them. Ads and Information About You.The Service may use third parties such as network advertisers and ad exchanges to serve advertisements on and off of the Service and may use third-party analytics and other service providers to evaluate and provide us and/or third parties with information about the use of the Service and viewing of ads and of our content. Network advertisers are third parties that display advertisements based on your visits and activities across the Internet and mobile media (\"Behavioral Ads\"). In addition, we may serve ads on our Service based on your Usage Information from your activities on our Service (\"Contextual Ads\"). Behavioral Ads and Contextual Ads enable us to target advertisements to you for products and services in which you might be interested. If you object to Contextual Ads, do not use our Service. If you object to Behavioral Ads, you can learn more about your ability to limit Behavioral Ads below.Our third-party ad network and exchange providers, advertisers, sponsors and/or traffic measurement services may themselves set and access their own cookies (including Flash cookies), web beacons and other Tracking Technologies on your Device and track certain behavioral Usage Information regarding users of your Device via a Device Identifier. These third-party Tracking Technologies may be set to, among other things: (a) help deliver advertisements to you that you might be interested in; (b) prevent you from seeing the same advertisements too many times; and (c) understand the usefulness to you of the advertisements that have been delivered to you. You acknowledge and agree that associated technology may access and use your Device and may set or change settings on your Device in connection with the associated operations. Note that any images (or any other parts of content) served by third parties in association with third-party ads or other content may serve as web beacons, which enable third parties to carry out the previously described activities.Third-party Tracking Technologies are not controlled by us, even if they are used to serve our ads or interact with our Service. Statements regarding our practices do not apply to the methods for collecting information used by these third parties or the use of the information that such third parties collect. We do however work with third parties to make efforts to have you provided with information on their practices and any available opportunity to exercise choice. The relevant third party's terms of service, privacy policy, permissions, notices and choices should be reviewed regarding their collection, storage and sharing practices. We make no representations regarding the policies or practices of third-party advertisers or advertising networks or exchanges or related third parties.Some third parties we work with may offer you certain choices regarding their practices, and information we have been informed of regarding such choices is available here. Further, while we and third party sites that display our ads may use a variety of companies to serve advertisements, you may wish to visit http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp, which provides information regarding this practice by Network Advertising Initiative (\"NAI\") members, and your choices regarding having this information used by these companies, including the \"opt-out\" procedures of NAI members. Opting out of one or more NAI members only means that those NAI members no longer will be allowed under their own rules to deliver Behavioral Ads to you, which will affect this and other sites, but does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content and/or ads. Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit this opt-out page, or you subsequently erase your cookies, use a different Device or change web browsers, your NAI opt-out may not, or may no longer, be effective. Therefore, if you use multiple Devices or multiple browsers on a single Device, you need to opt-out for each browser that you use on your Device. Additionally, if you delete your cookies, change browsers, or use a different Device, you will need to opt-out again. Additional information is available on the NAI's web site accessible by the above link. Where we serve third-party Behavioral Ads on the Service we participate in the notice and opt-out program run by the Digital Advertising Alliance (\"DAA\"), and you can learn more about it and the opt-out choices it offers at http://www.aboutads.info/choices/#completed. Where we serve our own Behavioral Ads on third party sites, we request that they comply with the DAA program so that you have the same notice and opt-out choice. Please note that similar limitations as described regarding NAI opt-out may apply to the DAA opt-out. Similar limitations may apply to these opt-out methods. We are not responsible for effectiveness of, or compliance with, any third-parties' opt-out options or programs. How Do I Change My Information and Communications Preferences.You are responsible for maintaining the accuracy of the information you submit to us, such as your contact information provided as part of registration. The Service may allow you to review, correct or update Personal Information you have provided through the Service's registration forms or otherwise, and you may provide registration updates and changes, and otherwise request access to your information, by contacting us at privacy@hmhco.com. If so, we will make good faith efforts to make requested changes in our then active databases as soon as reasonably practicable. With respect to our mobile and other applications (i.e., when we are the application publisher), you can prospectively stop all collection of information by the application by uninstalling the application. You may use the standard uninstall process as may be available as part of your applicable Device or potentially via the appropriate application or app marketplace. Please note that it is not always possible to completely remove or delete all of your information from our databases and that residual data may remain on backup media or for other reasons. Also, if you have made any public postings on the Service such as in forums or blogs, these communications cannot generally be removed. When you edit your Personal Information or change your preferences on the Service, information that you remove may persist internally for our administrative purposes. You may cancel or modify our e-mail marketing communications you receive from us by following the instructions contained within our promotional e-mails or in some cases by logging into your account and changing your communication preferences. This will not affect subsequent subscriptions and if your opt-out is limited to certain types of e-mails the opt-out will be so limited. To the extent permitted by applicable law, we reserve the right to send you certain communications relating to your Account or use of our Service, such as administrative and service announcements and, except as prescribed by applicable law, these transactional Account messages may be unaffected if you choose to opt-out from receiving our marketing communications. If you have any questions about the Privacy Policy or practices described in it, you should contact us by e-mail at: privacy@hmhco.com. What Should Parents Know About Children.We understand the importance of protecting children's privacy in the interactive world. We do not use the Service to knowingly collect Personal Information from children under the age of thirteen (13) without verified parental consent or as otherwise permitted by applicable law. Furthermore, most of the portions of our Service that are directed to children 12 years and under are designed so that we do not collect Personal Information at all. In the event any of the Services designed for children 12 years and under, or designed for both such children and older users, do have aspects where we may collect Personal information we will comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (\"COPPA\"), including its verified parental consent requirements. In addition, we will post a separate Children's Privacy Policy on such portions of the Services that explains further what types of Personal information may be collected, under what circumstances, for what purposes and what options parents have to approve or limit such collection.In the event that we become aware that we have collected Personal Information from any child absent the parental consent required by COPPA, or as otherwise permitted by COPPA, we will dispose of that information in accordance with applicable law. If you are a parent or guardian and you believe that your child under the age of 13 has provided us with information without your consent, please contact us at privacy@hmhco.com and we will take reasonable steps to ensure that such information is deleted from our files. What About Security.We incorporate commercially reasonable technical, physical and administrative safeguards to help protect and secure your Personal Information in our custody or control. However, no data transmission over the Internet, mobile networks, wireless transmission or electronic storage of information can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Please note that we cannot ensure the security of any information you transmit to us, and you use our Service and provide us with your information at your own risk. What About Changes To The Privacy Policy.We reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time without notice to you. Any changes will be effective immediately upon the posting of the revised Privacy Policy and your use of the Service indicates your consent to the privacy policy posted at the time of use.

To withdraw from the study, you can select 'Leave Study' on the settings tab in the app. We will retain any data already collected in the study before you withdrew. You can also request, via an email to [email protected] , that the researchers delete any of the observation data on your child that has already collected as part of study.Will I be contacted by e-mail.The app will ask you whether you want to be contacted. If you answer yes to this question, we may contact you for future studies or follow up questions.Where do I go for technical support.For technical support, please see Support or email us [email protected] .What does this Research Policy cover.This Research Policy covers our research of personally identifiable information ('Personal Information') that we gather when you are accessing or using the App. This Research Policy does not apply to the practices of companies or institutions that we do not own or control, or to individuals that we do not employ or manage.Your use of the App will allow you to provide us with Personal Information as outlined within the Informed Consent for each App. The App collects your Personal Information for the purposes of a research study being conducted. If you choose to use the App to provide us with any Personal Information, you must first review and acknowledge the Informed Consent form for the Study, which will be presented to you within the App.We do not knowingly collect or solicit Personal Information from anyone under the age of 18 or knowingly allow such persons to register for the App without parental consent. If you are under 18, you must not attempt to register for the App and you must not send any information about yourself to us, including but not limited to your name, address, telephone number, or email address without parental consent. In the event that we learn that we have collected Personal Information from a person under age 18 without parental consent, we will delete that information. If you believe that we might have any information from or about a person under the age of 18, please contact us using the contact information below. Some Apps may study children and will include parental consent and, when appropriate, child assent. In such cases, the parent or legal guardian must be over the age of 18 to provide consent and to complete the all portions of the Study with their child, or report on their child.What information does the App collect.Each App may obtain information from you in two ways. The first is information that you manually enter into the App (e.g., survey responses). The second is information that the App collects automatically about you from your device (e.g., phone or tablet) and/or wearable technology (e.g., wristwatch).The embedded Informed Consent for each App will tell you what items that specific App will be collecting. You may choose not to provide us with certain information. Some items automatically collected will be under your control and you may choose whether or not to provide this information by disabling/enabling this feature (e.g., GPS location information). Refusal to provide some items may exclude you from participation in the Study.This App may also automatically receive technical information relating to your usage of the App such as your operating system, device, features used, content viewed and downloaded, the dates and times of your interactions with the App and other information. We may use this information to understand, customize and improve user experience with the App and the Study. For example, we may engage third-party analytics services to analyze this information in order to help us understand how visitors engage with and navigate the App, how and when features within the App are used and by how many users. Under no circumstance, however, will your health information be disclosed to such third-party analytics services.Is Personal Information about me secure.All information that is collected through the App will be sent to a secure data server. We will replace the direct identifiers listed above (your name, email address, and date of birth) with a code to help protect your identity\u2014We will encrypt the direct identifiers and store them separately. Because the data are coded, researchers using the data will not be able readily to identify which information pertains to you. Otsimo researchers will, however, maintain your consent and personal information and retain the ability to re-identify the information if doing so is needed for research integrity purposes or legal purposes, and they may share re-identified information with others at Otsimo who need to see such information to ensure that the research meets legal, regulatory or institutional requirements.Access to the App on your smartdevice may be protected by a biometric authentication mechanism (such as Touch ID) or a passcode you select after downloading the app. You should take steps to prevent unauthorized access to your account and personal information by selecting and protecting your credentials appropriately and limiting access to your smartdevice.We endeavor to protect the privacy of the Personal Information we hold in our records, but we cannot guarantee complete security. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors, may compromise the security of your Personal Information at any time.The App may contain links to external websites. We are not responsible for the privacy policies and/or practices on websites that may be accessed through these links. When following a link to another website, you should read that website\u2019s privacy policy and make sure that you agree with it and can abide by it.It is recommended that you run a current operating system (OS) on your device, review the privacy/security settings often, and restrict any unnecessary access. Apps may run in the background of your device and may have unanticipated impact on the operations of your device (e.g., battery drainage). If you do not have an unlimited data/text plan, you may incur additional charges. At the conclusion of the study, you may wish to remove the App from your device.We are not asking you to make any health decisions based on the use of the App. You should discuss health decisions directly with your healthcare provider.We reserve the right to disclose information collected through the App as required by law, when we believe disclosure is necessary to comply with a regulatory requirement, judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on us, or to protect the safety, rights, or property of Otsimo or the public.What choices do I have.You may choose not to opt-in the study. If you choose not to opt-in the study, you can still use the app.You may stop all collection of information by the App at any time by withdrawing from the study on the profile page within the App or uninstalling the App. As explained further in each informed consent form, you will no longer be able to participate in the Study if you choose to uninstall the App. If you uninstall the App, we will retain all of information about you that was collected prior to that point and continue to use such information as described in this Research Policy. If you have questions about withdrawing, please contact the study team using the contact information within the app. When you withdraw from a study any data collected up to that point will be retained by the study team. If you wish to your study data deleted you will need to contact the study team using the contact information on the consent form or within the app. If a request to delete data is made we will do our best to remove your data from our systems.You may be able to add, update, or delete certain information as explained above. When you update or delete information, we may maintain a copy of the unrevised information in our records.1.

Children\u2019s Privacy.We recognize the need to provide further privacy protections with respect to personal information we may collect from children on our sites and applications. Some of the features on our sites and applications are age-gated so that they are not available for use by children, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children in connection with those features. When we intend to collect personal information from children, we take additional steps to protect children\u2019s privacy, including:.Notifying parents about our information practices with regard to children, including the types of personal information we may collect from children, the uses to which we may put that information, and whether and with whom we may share that information.In accordance with applicable law, obtaining consent from parents for the collection of personal information from their children, or for sending information about our products and services directly to their children.Limiting our collection of personal information from children to no more than is reasonably necessary to participate in an online activity.Giving parents access or the ability to request access to personal information we have collected from their children and the ability to request that the personal information be changed or deleted.Children\u2019s Online Privacy Policy.Otsimo, including for example Otsimo Child and Otsimo Family, is committed to protecting the privacy of children who use our sites and applications. This Children\u2019s Online Privacy Policy explains our information collection, disclosure, and parental consent practices with respect to information provided by children under the age of 13 ('child' or 'children'), and uses terms that are defined in our general Privacy Policy. This policy is in accordance with the U.S. Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act ('COPPA'), and outlines our practices in the United States and Latin America regarding children\u2019s personal information. For more information about COPPA and general tips about protecting children\u2019s online privacy, please visit OnGuard Online; https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0031-protecting-your-childs-privacy-online .a. The Information We Collect From Children, How We Use It, and How and When We Communicate With Parents.Otsimo offers to its users a range of sites and applications, some of which are primarily targeted at children, and others that are intended for users of all ages and their families. Our sites and applications offer a variety of activities, including activities that may collect information from children. Below we summarize potential instances of collection and outline how and when we will provide parental notice and/or seek parental consent. In any instance that we collect personal information from a child, we will retain that information only so long as reasonably necessary to fulfill the activity request or allow the child to continue to participate in the activity, and ensure the security of our users and our services, or as required by law. In the event we discover we have collected information from a child in a manner inconsistent with COPPA\u2019s requirements, we will either delete the information or immediately seek the parent\u2019s consent for that collection.Registration.Children can, in many cases, register with our sites and applications to view content, play games, participate in contests, and engage in special features, among other things. During the registration process, we may ask the child to provide certain information for notification and security purposes, including a parent or guardian\u2019s email address, the child\u2019s first name and gender, the child\u2019s member or account username, and password. We also may ask for birth dates from children to validate their ages. Please note that family or children can choose whether to share their information with us, but certain features cannot function without it. As a result, family or children may not be able to access certain features if required information has not been provided. We will not require a child to provide more information than is reasonably necessary in order to participate in an online activity.About the collection of parent email address: Consistent with the requirements of COPPA, on any child-targeted site or application, or in any instance where we ask for age and determine the user is age 12 or under, we will ask for a parent or guardian email address before we collect any personal information from the child. If you believe your child is participating in an activity that collects personal information and you or another parent/guardian have NOT received an email providing notice or seeking your consent, please feel free to contact us at [email protected] . We will not use parent emails provided for parental consent purposes to market to the parent, unless the parent has expressly opted in to email marketing or has separately participated in an activity that allows for such email contact.Content Generated by a Child.Certain activities on our sites and applications allow children to create or manipulate content and save it with Otsimo. Some of these activities do not require children to provide any personal information and therefore may not result in notice to the parent or require parental consent. If an activity potentially allows a child to insert personal information in their created content, we will either pre-screen the submission to delete any personal information, or we will seek verifiable parental consent by email for the collection. Examples of created content that may include personal information are stories or other open-text fields, and drawings that allow text or free-hand entry of information. If, in addition to collecting content that includes personal information, Otsimo also plans to post the content publicly or share it with a others for the others\u2019 own use, we will obtain a higher level of parental consent.About Verifiable Parental Consent:.Email Consent. In the event Otsimo wishes to collect personal information from a child, COPPA requires that we first seek a parent or guardian\u2019s consent by email. In the email we will explain what information we are collecting, how we plan to use it, how the parent can provide consent, and how the parent can revoke consent. If we do not receive parental consent within a reasonable time, we will delete the parent contact information and any other information collected from the child in connection with that activity.High-Level Consent. In the event Otsimo collects personal information from a child that will be posted publicly, we will seek a higher level of consent than email consent. Such 'high-level' methods of consent include but are not limited to verification, speaking to a trained customer service representative by telephone, or requiring a signed consent form by mail, email attachment, or fax. After providing high-level consent, a parent may have the opportunity to use a pin or password in future communications as a way to confirm the parent\u2019s identity.Teacher consent in lieu of a parent. With regard to school-based activities, COPPA allows teachers and school administrators to act in the stead of parents to provide consent for the collection of personal information from children. Schools should always notify parents about these activities. For more information on parental rights with respect to a child\u2019s educational record under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), please visit the FERPA site.Chat.Our games and activities that are NOT directed to children allow users to communicate directly with other users by means of a chat system. We haven\u2019t got any children chat system. We also recommend that parents carefully supervise their children when the children participate in online activities.Where Otsimo employs a chat system that does not filter all or nearly all personal information, we will first seek high-level consent from the parent.Email Contact with a Child.On occasion, in order to respond to a question or request from a child, Otsimo may need to ask for the child\u2019s online contact information, such as an email address. Otsimo will delete this information immediately after responding to the question or request.In connection with certain activities or services, we may collect a child\u2019s online contact information, such as an email address, in order to communicate with the child more than once. In such instances we will retain the child\u2019s online contact information to honor the request and for no other purpose such as marketing. One example would be a newsletter that provides occasional updates about a site, game/activity, television show, personality/character, or feature movie. Whenever we collect a child\u2019s online contact information for ongoing communications, we will simultaneously require a parent email address in order to notify the parent about the collection and use of the child\u2019s information, as well as to provide the parent an opportunity to prevent further contact with the child. On some occasions a child may be engaged in more than one ongoing communication, and a parent may be required to 'opt-out' of each communication individually.Push Notifications.Push notifications are notifications on mobile and other devices that are typically associated with downloaded applications, and which can communicate to the device holder even when the application is not in use. We will require a child to provide a parent email address before the child can receive push notifications from our child-directed applications that collect a device identifier. We will then provide the parent with notice of our contact with the child and will provide the parent the opportunity to prevent further notifications. Finally, we will not associate the device identifier with other personal information without contacting the parent to get consent.Geolocation Data.If a child-directed Otsimo site or application collects geolocation information that is specific enough to equate to the collection of a street address, we will first seek parental consent via email.Persistent Identifiers.When children interact with us, certain information may automatically be collected, both to make our sites and applications more interesting and useful to children and for various purposes related to our business. Examples include the type of computer operating system, the child\u2019s IP address or mobile device identifier, the web browser, the frequency with which the child visits various parts of our sites or applications, and information regarding the online or mobile service provider. This information is collected using technologies such as cookies, HTML5 cookies, web beacons, and other unique identifiers (which we define under the 'Online Tracking Technologies' section of our general Privacy Policy). This information may be collected by Otsimo. This data is principally used for internal purposes only, in order to:.provide children with access to features and activities on our sites and applications.customize content and improve our sites and applications.conduct research and analysis to address the performance of our sites and applications.generate anonymous reporting for use by Otsimo.In the event we collect (or allow others to collect) such information from children on our sites and.applications for other purposes, we will notify parents and obtain consent prior to such collection.Please contact us at the mailing address, email, or phone number below with questions about the operators\u2019 privacy policies and collection and use practices.b. When Information Collected From Children Is Available To Others.In addition to those rare instances where a child\u2019s personal information is posted publicly (after receiving high-level parental consent), we also may share or disclose personal information collected from children in a limited number of instances, including the following:.We may share information with our service providers if necessary for them to perform a business, professional, or technology support function for us.We may disclose personal information if permitted or required by law, for example, in response to a court order or a subpoena. To the extent permitted by applicable law, we also may disclose personal information collected from children (i) in response to a law enforcement or public agency\u2019s (including schools or children services) request; (ii) if we believe disclosure may prevent the instigation of a crime, facilitate an investigation related to public safety or protect the safety of a child using our sites or applications; (iii) to protect the security or integrity of our sites, applications, and other technology, as well as the technology of our service providers; or (iv) enable us to take precautions against liability.c. Parental Choices and Controls.At any time, parents can refuse to permit us to collect further personal information from their children in association with a particular account, and can request that we delete from our records the personal information we have collected in connection with that account. Please keep in mind that a request to delete records may lead to a termination of an account, membership, or other service.Where a child has registered for a Otsimo.com account, we use two methods to allow parents to access, change, or delete the personally identifiable information that we have collected from their children:.Parents can request access to and delete their child\u2019s personal information by logging on to the child\u2019s account through the Member Services Home Page located here. Parents will need their child\u2019s username and password. The Your Account home page explains how to recover a password if the child cannot recall it. Parents can contact Guest Services to request access to, change, or delete their child\u2019s personal information by sending an email to us at [email protected] . A valid request to delete personal information will be accommodated within a reasonable time.Data Security, Integrity and Retention.The security, integrity and confidentiality of your information are extremely important to us. We have implemented technical, administrative and physical security measures that are designed to protect guest information from unauthorized access, disclosure, use and modification. From time to time, we review our security procedures to consider appropriate new technology and methods. Please be aware though that, despite our best efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable. We will retain your personal information for the length of time needed to fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy policy unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.8. Data Transfers, Storage and Processing Globally.We operate globally and may transfer your personal information to individual companies of Otsimo in locations around the world for the purposes described in this privacy policy. Wherever your personal information is transferred, stored or processed by us, we will take reasonable steps to safeguard the privacy of your personal information. Additionally, when using or disclosing personal information transferred from the European Union, we abide by the Safe Harbor Principles as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce, use standard contract clauses approved by the European Commission, adopt other means under European Union law for ensuring adequate safeguards, or obtain your consent.

Some data processing may involve the transfer of certain Personal Data to 'third countries', i.e. countries outside of the European Economic Area, where the GDPR is not in force. Such a transfer is permissible if the European Commission has determined that an adequate level of data protection is provided in the relevant third country. This applies to all transfers to countries that are listed here:https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/adequacy-decisions_enIf an adequacy decision of the European Commission does not exist, a transfer of Personal Data to a third country will only take place if appropriate safeguards exist, or if one of the conditions listed in Art. 49 GDPR is met.

From the end of the calendar year in which the data was collected, we will retain Personal Data contained in our accounting records for ten years and Personal Data contained in commercial letters and contracts for six years. In addition, we will retain data in connection with consents that require evidence, as well as in connection with complaints and claims, for the duration of the statutory limitation periods in each case.

Teach Your Monster (Web-based Version) Privacy Policy.2. Teach Your Monster Mobile Application (iOS and Android) Privacy Policy.1. Teach Your Monster (Web-based Version) Privacy Policy.The Basics.This site and the games and other services offered through it, the 'Game Service', is intended to be used by teachers and parents/guardians as a reading-related teaching tool for children.

This Privacy Policy relates to your use of the Teach Your Monster Game Service. As the processing of some data is essential to the functioning of the Game Service if you do not accept the terms of this Privacy Policy you should not use the Game Service.The purpose of this Privacy Policy is to let you know what kinds of information we may gather about you (whether you are a User or a Student), how we may use that information, why your information will be used, namely for purposes of the performance of our contract with you as our User, whether we disclose it to anyone, and the choices you have regarding our use of the information. Words and phrases used in this Privacy Policy have the same meaning as is attributed to them in the Teach Your Monster User Agreement.This Privacy Policy provides you with certain information that must be provided under the UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR). This policy primarily covers how we use information relating to our parent/guardian Users who set up accounts on behalf of their own children. In these cases, we will be the 'data controller' for the purposes of data protection law. There are also cases where we will be a 'data processor' for the purposes of data protection law. Where schools, educators and/or teachers set up accounts on behalf of students, we are processing your personal information on behalf of the educator/school/teacher in order that they can provide educational services to their students. In circumstances where we are a data processor, it is the educator/school/teacher who decides what personal information to collect and how that information is used. Any questions that you may have relating to your personal information and your rights under data protection law should therefore be directed to the school/teacher as the data controller, not to us.It is important that you read this policy, together with any other privacy notice we may provide on specific occasions when we are collecting or processing personal information about you, so that you are aware of how and why we are using such information.Data Protection Principles.We are required by the UK GDPR to ensure that we follow six principles whilst we are processing your information and it is these principles that are central to our processing procedures. Your information will be:.Used lawfully, fairly and in a transparent way;Collected only for valid purposes that we have clearly explained to you and not used in any way that is incompatible with those purposes;Relevant to the purposes we have told you about and limited only to those purposes;Accurate and kept up to date;Kept only as long as necessary for the purposes we have told you about; andKept securely.Personal information we collect from you .Personal data, or personal information as we sometimes call it, means data which relates to an identifiable living person.

For example, our web server may automatically log which parts of the Game Service Users or Students view, their IP addresses and which web browsers they use. This technology does not identify the User or Student personally, but enables us to compile statistics about the use of the Game Service so we can improve it over time; it also enables us to adapt the Game Service to a Student\u2019s progress and ability.Cookies.Cookies are small files which, depending on your browser settings, may be automatically stored on your computer's hard drive when your Web browser accesses a specific Web page.We use cookies for purposes such as helping us to identify and track visitors\u2019 usage and preferences.We are of the view that these cookies are not intrusive.Teach Your Monster Cookie Policy.Note that you may not be able to obtain and use an Account on the Game Service, nor will you be able to use certain aspects of the Services, if your browser is set to reject cookies.You can find out how to manage cookies at this site: www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/.Why is your information collected.We will only use your personal information when the law allows us to. Most commonly, we will use your personal information in the following circumstances:.Where you have provided your consent.Where we need to perform the contract we are about to enter into or have entered into with you.Where it is necessary for our legitimate interests (or those of a third party) and your interests and fundamental rights do not override those interests.Where we need to comply with a legal or regulatory obligation.Your personal information will be collected, processed, stored and used by us, and passed to and processed by our subsidiary and/or affiliated companies and other data processors acting under contract with us for four main purposes:.To register you as a UserTo provide and promote the Game ServiceTo provide customer supportFor research and marketing purposes.We also use your personal information to provide emailed communications.

These emails are intrinsic to the Game Service, and cannot therefore be specifically opted-out of. Should you wish to stop receiving these emails from us, you must de-register as a User.Note that we only hold email addresses for Users: we do not send emails to Students.Sharing your personal data.In our capacity as data controller we will share your personal information with third parties where required by law, where it is necessary to administer the working relationship with you or where we have another legitimate interest in doing so.Here is a list of our third party providers.Any third parties will be bound by contractual provisions with us and only have access to personal data to perform the described purposes, and may not use it for other purposes. Further, they must process the personal data in accordance with this Privacy Policy and as permitted by the UK GDPR.It is possible that some of the computer systems and companies that process your data on our behalf may be based in countries outside the UK . Countries outside the UK may not have as well developed data protection laws to protect your information as those inside the UK, but we will contractually require that personal data which is processed on our behalf is treated in compliance with UK law and this Privacy Policy.Security.We take appropriate technical and organisational measures to guard against unauthorised or unlawful processing of your personal data and against accidental loss or destruction of, or damage to, your personal data. While no computer system is completely secure, we believe the measures implemented by our site reduce the likelihood of security problems to a level appropriate to the type of data involved. We have security measures in place to protect our User and Student database and access to this database is restricted internally. However, it remains each User's responsibility:.To ensure no-one else uses the Game Service while the User\u2019s machine is \"logged on\" to the Game Service;To log off or exit from your Account when not using it; andTo keep his/her password or other access information secret.We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected data security breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a suspected breach where we are legally required to do so.Marketing with third parties.We will obtain your express consent by opt-in before we share your personal data, with any third party for marketing purposes.

This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate information we hold about you corrected.In order to correct any of the information we hold about you, simply log into your account and make the changes that are required.c) Request erasure of your personal information. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal information where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal information where you have exercised your right to object to processing (see below).d) Object to processing of your personal information where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal information for direct marketing purposes.e) Request the restriction of processing of your personal information. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of personal information about you, for example if you want us to establish its accuracy or the reason for processing it.f) Request the transfer of your personal information to another party.If you want to review, verify, correct or request erasure of your personal information, object to the processing of your personal data, or request that we transfer a copy of your personal information to another party, please contact [email protected].

('Students').Teachers and parents/guardians may register on the site, and as a result become 'Users'.Users may set up individual accounts for their Students, which allow the Students to access, and the User to track Students\u2019 performance in their use of, the Game Service.Accounts may only be established by Users, and not by Students themselves; Students must have Users\u2019 permission to use the Game Service.Teach Your Monster Limited (we) are committed to protecting and respecting your privacy and personal data. This Privacy Policy relates to your use of the Teach Your Monster mobile application software (the App). As the processing of some data is essential to the functioning of the App if you do not accept the terms of this Privacy Policy you should not use the App.This privacy policy aims to give you information about how we collect and process your personal information through your use of the App (whether you are using the Standard Mode or Login Mode). It makes you aware of how and why your personal information will be used, namely for the purposes of the performance of our contract with you as our User, and how long it will usually be retained for. It provides you with certain information that must be provided under the UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR). This policy primarily covers how we use information relating to our parent/guardian Users who set up accounts on behalf of their own children. In these cases, we will be the 'data controller' for the purposes of data protection law. There are also cases where we will be a 'data processor' for the purposes of data protection law. Where educators, teachers or schools set up accounts on behalf of students, we are processing your personal information on behalf of the school/teacher in order that they can provide educational services to their students. In circumstances where we are a data processor, it is the educator/school/teacher who decides what personal information to collect and how that information is used. Any questions that you may have relating to your personal information and your rights under data protection law should therefore be directed to the school/teacher as the data controller, not to us.It is important that you read this policy, together with any other privacy notice we may provide on specific occasions when we are collecting or processing personal information about you, so that you are aware of how and why we are using such information.Scope.The App works in tandem with the website www.teachyourmonster.org (the Website) which is run and operated by 'Teach Your Monster Ltd ('TYM Ltd').

You may not use or export the Materials in violation of U.S. laws and regulations.13. Dispute Resolution By Binding Arbitration.PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY AS IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS.a. Agreement to Arbitrate.This Dispute Resolution by Binding Arbitration section is referred to in these Terms of Use as the 'Arbitration Agreement.' You agree that any and all disputes or claims that have arisen or may arise between you and Linqto, whether arising out of or relating to these Terms of Use (including any alleged breach thereof), the Application, any advertising, or any aspect of the relationship or transactions between us, will be resolved exclusively through final and binding arbitration, rather than a court, in accordance with the terms of this Arbitration Agreement, except that you may assert individual claims in small claims court, if your claims qualify. Further, this Arbitration Agreement does not preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies, and such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf. You agree that, by entering into these Terms of Use, you and Linqto are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. Your rights will be determined by a neutral arbitrator, not a judge or jury. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement.b. Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief.YOU AND LINQTO AGREE THAT EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING. UNLESS BOTH YOU AND COMPANY AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN MORE THAN ONE PERSON\u2019S OR PARTY\u2019S CLAIMS AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, OR CLASS PROCEEDING. ALSO, THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY THAT PARTY\u2019S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S), EXCEPT THAT YOU MAY PURSUE A CLAIM FOR AND THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD PUBLIC INJUNCTIVE RELIEF UNDER APPLICABLE LAW TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED FOR THE ENFORCEABILITY OF THIS PROVISION.c. Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution.Linqto is always interested in resolving disputes amicably and efficiently, and most customer concerns can be resolved quickly and to the customer\u2019s satisfaction by emailing customer support at invest@linqto.com. If such efforts prove unsuccessful, a party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute ('Notice'). The Notice to Linqto should be sent to 101 Metro Drive, Suite 335, San Jose, CA 95110 ('Notice Address'). The Notice must (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought. If Linqto and you do not resolve the claim within sixty (60) calendar days after the Notice is received, you or Linqto may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by Linqto or you will not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or Linqto is entitled.d. Arbitration Procedures.Arbitration will be conducted by a neutral arbitrator in accordance with the American Arbitration Association\u2019s ('AAA') rules and procedures, including the AAA\u2019s Consumer Arbitration Rules (collectively, the 'AAA Rules'), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement. For information on the AAA, please visit its website, https://www.adr.org. Information about the AAA Rules and fees for consumer disputes can be found at the AAA\u2019s consumer arbitration page, https://www.adr.org/consumer. If there is any inconsistency between any term of the AAA Rules and any term of this Arbitration Agreement, the applicable terms of this Arbitration Agreement will control unless the arbitrator determines that the application of the inconsistent Arbitration Agreement terms would not result in a fundamentally fair arbitration. The arbitrator must also follow the provisions of these Terms of Use as a court would. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including issues relating to the scope, enforceability, and arbitrability of this Arbitration Agreement. Although arbitration proceedings are usually simpler and more streamlined than trials and other judicial proceedings, the arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual under these Terms of Use and applicable law. Decisions by the arbitrator are enforceable in court and may be overturned by a court only for very limited reasons.Unless Linqto and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in a reasonably convenient location for both parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances. If the parties are unable to agree on a location, the determination will be made by AAA. If your claim is for $10,000 or less, Linqto agrees that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. If your claim exceeds $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator will issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based.e. Costs of Arbitration.Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees (collectively, the 'Arbitration Fees') will be governed by the AAA Rules, unless otherwise provided in this Arbitration Agreement. If the value of the relief sought is $75,000 or less, at your request, Linqto will pay all Arbitration Fees. If the value of relief sought is more than $75,000 and you are able to demonstrate to the arbitrator that you are economically unable to pay your portion of the Arbitration Fees or if the arbitrator otherwise determines for any reason that you should not be required to pay your portion of the Arbitration Fees, Linqto will pay your portion of such fees. In addition, if you demonstrate to the arbitrator that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, Linqto will pay as much of the Arbitration Fees as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive. Any payment of attorneys\u2019 fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.f. Confidentiality.All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, and any ruling, decision, or award by the arbitrator, will be strictly confidential for the benefit of all parties.g. Severability.If a court or the arbitrator decides that any term or provision of this Arbitration Agreement (other than the subsection (b) above titled 'Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief' above) is invalid or unenforceable, the parties agree to replace such term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and this Arbitration Agreement will be enforceable as so modified. If a court or the arbitrator decides that any of the provisions of subsection (b) above titled 'Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief' are invalid or unenforceable, then the entirety of this Arbitration Agreement will be null and void, unless such provisions are deemed to be invalid or unenforceable solely with respect to claims for public injunctive relief. The remainder of these Terms of Use will continue to apply.h. Future Changes to Arbitration Agreement.Notwithstanding any provision in these Terms of Use to the contrary, Linqto agrees that if it makes any future change to this Arbitration Agreement (other than a change to the Notice Address) while you are a user of the Use, you may reject any such change by sending Linqto written notice within thirty (30) calendar days of the change to the Notice Address provided above.

Mental Health Conditions.AnxietyIt is becoming increasingly common that children and young people in your school or classroom may be diagnosed with anxiety. Symptoms of anxiety in children vary, but it\u2019s important that you are able to understand and recognise how this might affect learning in a classroom environment. It\u2019s normal for everyone to feel anxious from time to time \u2013 it\u2019s a normal response to stress. However, some young people may experience uncontrollable levels of anxiety that are excessive in relation to what\u2019s happening around them \u2013can therefore struggle with their day-to-day tasks and schoolwork. Common worries can become overwhelming for children and young people with anxiety leading to them becoming quite distressed. If this does happen there are a few ways in which you can respond to try and calm the situation. Some signs and symptoms to look out for include tears when entering school, being withdrawn from their peers, concentration difficulties, fidgeting, changes in appetite, and irritability. Download our factsheet for more information on what to look for if you suspect a child or young person in your class is suffering from anxiety. Getting the conversation going can be a good starting point \u2013 for example, planning lessons themed around\u2026DepressionDepression is a common yet serious mood disorder that involves a persistence of deep sadness, hopelessness, and numbness. Someone experiencing depressing may feel a constant melancholy that prevents them from enjoying their everyday life. Children and young people especially can feel alone and misunderstood which often stops them from expressing how they feel to people close to them. This isolation can lead to suicidal feelings, self-harm and, in a worst-case scenario, suicide. Parents and teachers are often the first to identify the symptoms of depression in children and young people. Some key symptoms of depression include excessive and persistent worry, moodiness, over or undereating, and self-harm. Some symptoms manifest in physical ways that are a little easier to spot as a teacher during school time such as frequent aches and pains, not wanting to play, either complete isolation or clinginess, and uncharacteristic irritability and anger. There are many risk factors at school that can lead a child to develop depression. As a teacher, you should be on the lookout for children experiencing bullying, social isolation, a lack of self-confidence, and an inability to keep up with schoolwork, among other factors. Children particularly vulnerable to depression are ones who experience abuse,\u2026OCDObsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) is a mental health condition that involves repetitive, intrusive, and impulsive thoughts and images entering the mind, causing intense anxiety. As a result of this anxiety, the child or young person engages in compulsive or repetitive behaviours designed to ease their anxiety. They then obsessively repeat these behaviours to rid themselves of the anxiety, causing detriment to their daily life. Early signs of OCD can include excessive worrying and feeling a strong sense of responsibility over yourself and others. A child or young person will ask for constant reassurance about whether their homework is correct or whether they are doing something right or being a good student as they no longer trust their own judgement. As a teacher, these are early signs you can look out for which can inform how you approach the child going forward. Stress at school and bullying are key factors which exacerbate the development of OCD \u2013 the more overwhelmed a child feels, the more they give into their compulsive, repetitive behaviours to ease their anxiety. As a teacher, it is your duty to make sure the classroom is a safe space for all, keeping an eye on students who seem\u2026PTSDPTSD or post-traumatic stress disorder can be triggered in children and young people when they experience a particularly horrifying or scarring event. The cause can be as varied as a car crash or sexual assault. A child can develop PTSD if they are involved in this event, witnessed it, or even heard about it second-hand. It can be difficult to identify PTSD in children and young people, as they are reluctant to talk about the trauma they experienced as a way to protect themselves. However, there are some tell-tale signs of PTSD that you can look out for in your students. Children with PTSD will often have trouble concentrating and may even fall asleep during school time due to the lack of sleep they\u2019re having at home, making learning much harder. A sudden plummet in grades is also a red flag \u2013 in such cases, it is important to check up on the student rather than reprimand them, which can cause further harm. PTSD also causes many children or young people to become highly irritable and angry due to the intense emotions they\u2019re experiencing, often making them see other people as a threat. In this case, it is important to\u2026Eating DisordersAn eating disorder develops when a child\u2019s and young person\u2019s emotional well-being gets tangled up with their eating habits \u2013 for example, if their self-esteem is dependent on how much they eat or don\u2019t eat. Eating disorders are most common in teenagers between the ages of 13 to 17 and they can manifest in a multitude of ways. Anorexia nervosa is a serious mental illness where a person has an intense fear of gaining weight, often accompanied by body dysmorphia \u2013 a distorted view of one\u2019s body. This fear leads them to eat very little or nothing at all, leading to severe and potentially life-threatening weight loss. Bulimia nervosa is a serious mental illness that stems from being shamed about consuming large amounts of food, and your weight. A person will binge eat as much food as they can in a short space of time \u2013 this is often out of their control. They will then purge \u2013 making themselves throw up all the food they have eaten to avoid putting on weight from the binge. This leads to severe and potentially life-threatening weight loss. Binge eating is a serious mental illness which, similarly to Bulimia, involves consuming large amounts\u2026Self-HarmSelf-harm in children and young people happens when a person experiences an overwhelming flood of emotions such as guilt, shame, anger, hate, and a lack of control. This leads them to inflict deliberate harm upon themselves as a way to relieve the flood of emotions they are experiencing and punish themselves for feeling them in the first place. This can take the form of cutting themselves with sharp objects, over-eating or under-eating, pulling their hair out, burning themselves, and misusing intoxicants such as alcohol and drugs. Distress and overwhelming emotions often manifest during school time, and as a teacher it is important to have an awareness that school can be a trigger for students struggling with self-harming tendencies. Create a safe and open space for all students by letting your students know you are always here to support and hear them out whenever they need it. Common signs of self-harm include cuts, burns, and hair-pulling \u2013 these are easier to spot as they are often visible on the student\u2019s body. However, young people can be very good at hiding their scars under long jumpers and trousers. If a student is adamant about keeping their jumper on even during hot temperatures,\u2026TraumaIf a child in your care is suffering with Trauma, they will be very distressed. This may be obvious, or it may show up in the form of physical ailments such as headaches or vomiting. They may show signs of regression in toileting or feeding, struggle with their schoolwork or find it difficult to concentrate. Watch our Informational film on Trauma and Children with Dr Sian Williams and Dr David Trickey to understand how children react to Trauma and how they can be helped. Neurodivergent Conditions.ADHDADHD, or Attention Deficit and Hyperactivity Disorder, presents itself in many ways which can sometimes make it difficult for teachers to spot the signs. It is characterised by difficulties in the areas of attention, level of activity and impulse control. ADHD is a recognised developmental disorder which can affect many areas of a child\u2019s life \u2013 including in a learning environment. It is common for ADHD to be misdiagnosed in girls, as the symptoms of ADHD present differently to that of boys, and aren\u2019t as commonly shared. One of the most important things you can do as a teacher for a student with ADHD is to learn and understand how they are feeling, and how they see the world around them. Sometimes for students with ADHD it may feel like nobody understands them. In this video, we go through our tips for teachers who have a child in their class who has Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Also, view our Practical Tips for Teachers in the Classroom below .AutismConduct Disorders/ODDODD, or oppositional defiant disorder, is diagnosed in children and young people that are persistently and repetitively antisocial, disobedient, have frequent tantrums, can not listen to authority, and purposely harm others. Conduct disorders are the most common disorders in children and are more frequent in boys, with 7% of boys and 3% of girls meeting the criteria for conduct disorders. It is normal for children and young people to be defiant towards authority to some degree, but if a particular student stands out from the others in your class and is perpetually defiant, violent and resentful towards others, this can develop into ODD. A child or young person with ODD will often engage in a range of violent and destructive behaviours such as fighting, temper tantrums, arguing with adults and peers, and lying and blaming others for their behaviour. In some extreme cases, the child or young person may engage in being cruel to animals and starting fires. As a teacher, it can be difficult to know how to handle a student with ODD in a way that ensures they make the most of their learning and helps their behaviours and social relationships. However, there are things you can do\u2026DyslexiaChildren with Dyslexia have a different intelligence, way of thinking and way of seeing the world. Many innovators, inventors and successful entrepreneurs have been Dyslexic. Dyslexic thinking skills include imagination, inspiration, creativity and the ability to solve things. They sometimes find it difficult to fit into rigorous, inflexible education methods. Our resources for teachers and professionals on Dyslexia explain that if the condition is spotted early, there are strategies that can be used to work on the strengths of Dyslexic children which will allow them to develop different talents and thrive in life.

For example, we use the name and picture you provide in your account to identify you to other Service users. Our Services also include tailored features that personalize your experience, enhance your productivity, and improve your ability to collaborate effectively with others by automatically analyzing the activities of your team to provide search results, activity feeds, notifications, connections and recommendations that are most relevant for you and your team. For example, we may use your stated job title and activity to return search results we think are relevant to your job function. We also use information about you to connect you with other team members seeking your subject matter expertise. We may use your email domain to infer your affiliation with a particular organization or industry to personalize the content and experience you receive on our websites. Where you use multiple Services, we combine information about you and your activities to provide an integrated experience, such as to allow you to find information from one Service while searching from another or to present relevant product information as you travel across our websites. Based on your interactions with different StudyDrome products and advertisements, we will personalize your experience and tailor our communications and offers to you. To opt out of this personalization, please contact privacy@studydrome.com.\u200bFor research and development: We are always looking for ways to make our Services smarter, faster, secure, integrated, and useful. We use information and collective learnings (including feedback) about how people use our Services to troubleshoot, to identify trends, usage, activity patterns, and areas for integration and to improve our Services and to develop new products, features and technologies that benefit our users and the public. For example, to improve the @mention feature, we automatically analyze recent interactions among users and how often they @mention one another to surface the most relevant connections for users. We automatically analyze and aggregate frequently used search terms to improve the accuracy and relevance of suggested topics that auto-populate when you use the search feature. In some cases, we apply these learnings across our Services to improve and develop similar features, to better integrate the Services you use, or to provide you with insights based on how others use our Services. We also test and analyze certain new features with some users before rolling the feature out to all users.\u200b.To communicate with you about the Services: We use your contact information to send transactional communications via email and within the Services, including confirming your purchases, reminding you of subscription expirations, responding to your comments, questions and requests, providing customer support, and sending you technical notices, updates, security alerts, and administrative messages. We send you email notifications when you or others interact with you on the Services. Depending on your chosen method of contact, we may send you SMS notifications or call you. We also provide tailored communications based on your activity and interactions with us. For example, certain actions you take in the Services may automatically trigger a feature or third-party app suggestion within the Services that would make that task easier. We also send you communications as you onboard to a particular Service to help you become more proficient in using that Service. These communications are part of the Services and in most cases you cannot opt out of them. If an opt out is available, you will find that option within the communication itself or in your account settings.\u200b.To market, promote and drive engagement with the Services: We use your contact information and information about how you use the Services to send promotional communications that may be of specific interest to you, including by email and by displaying StudyDrome ads on other companies\u2019 websites and applications.

Such information may include contact information, identification, and demographic information, and device information and identifiers. You should always check the privacy settings and notices in these third-party services to understand how those third-parties may use your information.\u200b.Third Party Widgets: Some of our services contain widgets and social media features, such as the Twitter 'tweet' button or Facebook 'like' button.

We strongly recommend that server or data center users configure SSL to prevent interception of information transmitted over networks and to restrict access to the databases and other storage points used.How long we keep information.How long we keep information we collect about you depends on the type of information, as described in further detail below. After such time, we will either delete or de-identify your information or, if this is not possible (for example, because the information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your information and isolate it from any further use until deletion is possible.\u200b.Account information: We retain your account information for as long as your account is active and a reasonable period thereafter in case you decide to re-activate the Services. We also retain some of your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, to resolve disputes, to enforce our agreements, to support business operations, and to continue to develop and improve our Services. Where we retain information for Service improvement and development, we take steps to eliminate information that directly identifies you, and we only use the information to uncover collective insights about the use of our Services, not to specifically analyze personal characteristics about you.\u200b.Information you share on the Services: If your account is deactivated or disabled, some of your information and the content you have provided will remain in order to allow your team members or other users to make full use of the Services. For example, we continue to display messages you sent to the users that received them and continue to display content you provided, but when requested details that can identify you will be removed.\u200b.Managed accounts: If the Services are made available to you through an organization (e.g., your employer), we retain your information as long as required by the administrator of your account. For more information, see 'Managed accounts and administrators' above.Marketing information: If you have elected to receive marketing emails from us, we retain information about your marketing preferences for a reasonable period of time from the date you last expressed interest in our Services, such as when you last opened an email from us or ceased using your StudyDrome account.

Below is a summary of those choices, how to exercise them and any limitations.Your Choices:.You have the right to request a copy of your information, to object to our use of your information (including for marketing purposes), to request the deletion or restriction of your information, or to request your information in a structured, electronic format. Below, we describe the tools and processes for making these requests. You can exercise some of the choices by logging into the Services and using settings available within the Services or your account. Where the Services are administered for you by an administrator (see 'Notice to End Users' below), you may need to contact your administrator to assist with your requests first. For all other requests, you may contact us as provided in the Contact Us section below to request assistance.\u200b.Your request and choices may be limited in certain cases: for example, if fulfilling your request would reveal information about another person, or if you ask to delete information which we or your administrator are permitted by law or have compelling legitimate interests to keep. Where you have asked us to share data with third parties, for example, by installing third-party apps, you will need to contact those third-party service providers directly to have your information deleted or otherwise restricted.

Let us know if you have any questions.Imagine Learning LLC ('Imagine Learning', 'we' or 'us') is committed to protecting the privacy of students, parents, and educators, while providing students and schools with a dynamic learning and teaching environment made possible by the Internet. This Privacy Policy addresses the privacy practices of Imagine Learning. Imagine Learning\u2019s products and services are intended for ultimate use by parents, teachers and students, but only schools and school districts (together with similar purchase entities, 'Local Educational Agencies' or 'LEAs') may sign up for Imagine Learning. This Privacy Policy is applicable to all Imagine Learning products and services available online (the 'Services').If we intend to use or disclose members\u2019 Personal Information (as defined below) in a manner materially different from that stated at the time of collection we will send notification by email to those who have shared with us their email addresses.What is This Policy.WE FULLY DESCRIBE OUR PRIVACY PRACTICES BELOW IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY. THIS SUMMARY PROVIDES AN OVERVIEW OF SOME IMPORTANT INFORMATION REGARDING OUR USE AND SHARING OF YOUR INFORMATION, AND THIRD PARTIES WHO MAY SET COOKIES OR WEB BEACONS OR SIMILAR TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES WHEN YOU USE THE SERVICES. PLEASE READ THE ENTIRE PRIVACY POLICY VERY CAREFULLY. BY USING ANY SERVICE, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THIS PRIVACY POLICY IN ITS ENTIRETY.Information Collection/How we use your information: We primarily use the information we collect when you use the Services in connection with your relationship with Imagine Learning, your use of the Services, and for sending you information from us.Information Sharing: Remember that if you create an account or share Personal Information with other users on the Services, your information may be visible to others. However, student data will only be visible to their administrators, teachers and parents, and students cannot share data with other students. Note that we do not share your Personal Information with third parties for their marketing purposes; however, we may share your Personal Information under certain limited circumstances.Third party analytics providers: We work with analytics service providers and other vendors to provide us with information regarding traffic on our websites or through our service (collectively referred to as 'Sites'), including the pages viewed and the actions users take when visiting the Sites and to provide us with information regarding the use of the Sites.How Are Accounts Created.Users must create an Imagine Learning account to access certain portions of our site. The use of the Imagine Learning website is contingent on our processing of your Personal Information as set forth in this Privacy Policy. By creating an account and/or using the website, you are consenting to such practices. If you do not consent to our processing of your Personal Information as set forth in this Privacy Policy, you should not use our website.When LEAs purchase licenses, Imagine Learning creates an organization in the product and grants administrative access to that organization through a primary account. The LEA then enrolls students and teachers/administrators into schools and classrooms and creates accounts on their behalf. When the LEA creates student accounts, they are acting on behalf of parents to give Imagine Learning permission to collect the information described in this Privacy Policy, and Imagine Learning is acting as a service provider to the LEA.When the primary account belongs to a LEA, student accounts will be populated in coordination with that LEA. Students will then be provided login information in a manner specific to that district and in accordance with LEA policy, which may in some cases be through a LEA-wide 'single sign-on' or by communicating an initial login and password to the student.Some Services may also allow a LEA to create a parent account tied to a student account if so desired.Consent by LEAs, Teachers, and Parents.If you are a student of any age, you must get permission from your LEA or LEA-authorized representative to use the Services.Imagine Learning Services are not offered directly to students on any basis, and LEAs must first sign up for primary accounts, and then invite students, teachers, and parents to use Imagine Learning through the accounts they create. LEAs that have obtained licenses must provide consent on behalf of students for Imagine Learning to collect and use student data described in this Privacy Policy and opt to allow for student account creation.What Information Does Imagine Learning Collect About Students, Teachers, and Parents.Information shared with us: We may collect 'Personal Information' (which is information that can reasonably be used, alone or in combination with other reasonably available information, to identify or contact a specific individual). Personal Information includes, but is not limited to, student data, metadata, and user content. The information that we collect from logged-in users includes information that you voluntarily provide to us when you use your account and information that is automatically collected when you are logged into the Imagine Learning platform. The information collected depends on whether you are a teacher, LEA, parent, or student and may vary slightly from product to product. Below is a list of information collected across all our Services.Student Account:.Required student information.Student first and last name.Grade level.Language.Student number.Student username and password for our Services.LEA name.Information provided through use of our Services:.Assessment results and scores including academic performance and placement, psychographic information, and screening results.Curriculum progress.Audio recordings.Student-generated content (e.g., responses to writing prompts and math journals).Communications (such as chat text logs between students and certified teachers, grade commentary, etc.).Certificates of achievement and curriculum completion.Optional student information (Note that we will never condition a student\u2019s participation in an activity on the student\u2019s disclosure of more Personal Information than is necessary to participate in the activity).Single sign-on ID (for schools that use a single sign-on functionality).Demographic information (such as date of birth, gender, ethnicity/race, language).Special indicators (such as Individual Education Plan (IEP) status, English-Language Learner (ELL) status, living situations (foster care/homeless), low-income status etc.).Organization number (e.g., school or district identifier, state identification, or other number).Student email.Teacher/Administrator Account:.Teacher/Administrator first and last name.Teacher/Administrator title.Email address.LEA name.State.Teacher/Administrator username and password for our Services.Single sign-on ID (for schools that use a single sign-on functionality).Certificates of completion for online training.Parent Account (optional):.Parent first and last name.Email address.Parent username and password for our Services.Information collected from our marketing website: Independent of our Services used by students and teachers, we have websites limited to those browsing our marketing content. Our marketing websites collect some data, such as name and contact information, via online forms and some data via cookies and other social media trackers used on marketing pages.Information received from third parties: Third parties may provide us with information about you. For example, if you are on a third-party website, and opt-in to receive information from us, that third party will forward information to us so that we may contact you as requested. Any personal information received from these third parties will be handled in accordance with this Privacy Policy and our agreements with these parties. We sometimes combine information we receive from third parties with the personal information we collect through the Services. Any such combined information will be treated as Personal Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.Information we collect automatically: In every case we also log certain detailed technical information about all users\u2019 interactions with our Services that could be linked with users (including students). This includes the IP addresses that we get when users connect to our Services, information that is sent by web browsers automatically when they connect to our Services (such as the type of web browser, the operating system used and the time zone set on the user\u2019s computer), and the timing and frequency of how users interact with different content and different areas of our Sites.We use following methods and tools to collect and track the automatically collected information described above:.Cookies: Like many other websites and apps, we set cookies so that we may recognize when someone connecting to our Sites is currently logged in or has visited before. A cookie is a data file sent to a browser from a web server and stored on the user\u2019s computer\u2019s hard drive that allows us to recognize that browser when the user returns to our Sites. To learn more about browser cookies, including how to manage or delete them, look in the Tools, Help or similar section of your browser, or visit http://www.allaboutcookies.org.How we respond to Do Not Track signals: Please note that your browser setting may allow you to automatically transmit a 'Do Not Track' (DNT) signal to websites and online service you visit. DNT is a privacy preference users can set in certain web browsers to inform websites and services that they do not want certain information about their webpage visits collected over time and across websites or online services. However, we do not recognize or respond to browser-initiated DNT signals, as the internet industry is still working to determine what DNT means, how to comply with DNT, and how to create a common approach to responding to DNT. To find out more about 'Do Not Track', please visit http://www.allaboutdnt.com.Like most online services, when you use the Services, we automatically collect and store details of how you used our service, such as your activity on the Services, and the frequency and duration of your visits.By using our Services you agree to our use of these information collection technologies.De-identified and Aggregate Data.We frequently aggregate information in a way that is designed to make it impracticable to use that data to identify a particular person. We also sometimes maintain individual data records with personal identifiers removed in a manner that is impracticable to relink it to any specific individual. In this Privacy Policy, we refer to such data as 'De-Identified Data' and do not consider it to be Personal Information. We do not attempt to re-identify information that has been de-identified.What Student Information Can Other Users See.When the primary account belongs to a LEA, the account administrator designated by the LEA can access all information we collect about students that we make available through our websites and online services. LEA-designated administrators can delegate the right to view student information in accordance with LEA policy. Each teacher within that LEA can see only information relating to students\u2019 participation in classes taught by that teacher (unless granted additional access by the LEA account administrator).Some Services may allow a LEA to create a parent account tied to a student account if so desired. Parents may view student information only for the student accounts to which they\u2019ve been linked.What Does Imagine Learning Do With Personal Information.We will not share Personal Information we collect in any way not described by this Privacy Policy. Except as noted below, we do not share any Personal Information with third parties for advertising, marketing, or other purposes. There is no third-party advertising on Imagine Learning. We do not amass student profiles except in the furtherance of school purposes. We do not ask or require students to provide information beyond that which is reasonably necessary to provide the Services. Except in limited instances to provide support services under an agreement, we do not share any student login information with any third party, and we do not automatically collect Personal Information from student accounts. Information collected from students is never used or disclosed for any third-party advertising or any kind of behaviorally targeted advertising. We do not market to or survey students; however, students may choose to provide ratings and other feedback about their experience with learning activities. LEA staff may be invited to provide feedback about their experiences, but participation is never required. Students are occasionally asked to provide feedback on their enjoyment level of various aspects of the Services.We do collect website usage information through third-party analytics services and anonymized data to help us improve our experiences for students, but such information does not contain Personal Information. We also collect website usage information through third-party analytics services for non-student users to support product support and development.We use Personal Information and any other information collected through the website for the following reasons:.to administer the Services;.to improve the quality and types of services that we deliver;.to analyze usage of the Services and the popularity and performance of our Sites;.to communicate with parents, teachers and LEAs by responding to your requests, comments and questions;.to track and assess student development and progress;.to generate reports that allow parents, teachers, and other authorized persons to evaluate student progress, identify students who need intervention, and discover students who can be taught together as a group;.to diagnose technical problems;.to email parents, teachers, and other authorized persons regarding service, technical and other administrative matters. These communications may also include information regarding changes in services, new service offerings and important service-related notices, such as security and fraud notices. Such communications will only be delivered to parents, teachers and LEAs and will never be delivered to student users;.to send users alerts to notify them about pertinent activity on our Services, such as messages from colleagues or upcoming assignments ('Notification Alerts'). These Notification Alerts may be sent to all users of our Services, including students;.to provide useful analyses to users and primary account owners;.to conduct research and analytics to improve our Services and value to you, and to perform research for authorized persons;.to protect Imagine Learning and our users, such as conducting audits or notifying LEAs of inappropriate or potentially harmful behavior;.to assist students who request online help from our state-certified, security-cleared teachers who are employed by Imagine Learning to provide individualized instruction;.for other educational purposes requested and sanctioned by an authorized representative of the LEA;.for billing, account management, and other administrative matters;.to comply with a judicial order, subpoena or other legal request; or.as required by applicable law or regulation.Third Parties.How We Share Information.We use third-party service providers to provide a variety of services, such as assisting us with providing customer support, hosting our Services, providing us with analytics about how people use our Services, assisting us with marketing our Services to LEA administrators and teachers, sending and tracking responses to email, providing a framework for the delivery of assessment tools and analytics, storing data, providing single sign-on services (where applicable), and helping us identify and track bugs and errors in our Services. Student analytics data are anonymous, but teacher analytics data include teacher name and email address. Third parties we work with are contractually prohibited from using any Personal Information for any purpose other than providing the services we request from them.When a LEA is the primary account holder, we share information with third parties at the direction of the LEA, and it is the LEA\u2019s responsibility to make such requests in a manner that is consistent with their internal policies and the law. We may also share information that we collect in the following (or comparable) circumstances:.if we believe in good faith that it is necessary to disclose the information under any applicable law or regulation (for example, in response to a court order or a subpoena);.if we believe in good faith that it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person;.to investigate and act upon potential violations of the law or of our terms of service;.to provide information to a claimed owner of intellectual property who claims that content you have provided infringes on their rights;.in response to bankruptcy proceedings;.with teachers (and parents where necessary) so they can see information about their students or children, such as the student\u2019s or child\u2019s name, school affiliation and activity on assignments (including time of activity and any responses to questions, extending to grades for those assignments);.when any user logs into Imagine Learning with a third-party account (such as a ClassLink, Clever, Google or other Learning Management System account), that third party will learn that that user has visited Imagine Learning, and that information will be subject to that third party\u2019s privacy policy and practices;.with third-party products specifically configured by LEAs to interoperate with Imagine Learning;.if the information is De-Identified Data;.with our corporate affiliates, parents, and/or subsidiaries; or.in other circumstances that you expressly consent to.When logged into our Services, users may choose to interact with Google APIs to submit assignments to our learning management system. For example, users may log into their Google Drive account to select files they wish to upload to the Services as work products. As another example, LEAs may choose to integrate our Services with Google Classroom, linking students from our Services to their corresponding accounts in Google Classroom. If configured by the LEA, this can make it easier for students to login to the Services (i.e., Single Sign-On) without entering another username and password. This may also allow scores and grades from our Services to be automatically passed back to Google Classroom, making it easier for teachers to create and assign work, manage scores, and streamline reporting. Imagine Learning\u2019s use and transfer to any other app of information received from Google APIs will adhere to Google API Services User Data Policy, including the Limited Use requirements.We will not sell Personal Information to anyone for monetary compensation. However, we do share Personal Information that could be considered a \u2018sale\u2019 under the California Consumer Privacy Act such as in connection with the sale of Imagine Learning\u2019s equity or assets or a merger of Imagine Learning with another company. Any sale or merger would be conditioned so that such information will continue to be covered by the then-applicable Privacy Policy or a policy at least as robust as such Privacy Policy.If there are changes to this Privacy Policy in the future, LEAs, teachers, and parents may agree to those changes through continued use of the Services or choose to stop using Imagine Learning and we will delete their information and the information about their students.Third Party Content, Links to Other Sites, and Imagine Learning Content Found Outside the Site.Certain content provided through the Services may be hosted and served by third parties. In addition, our Services includes some links to third party sites or content over which Imagine Learning has no control and which are governed by the privacy policies and business practices of those third parties. We are not responsible for the data collection practices on those other sites. We advise you to carefully review those sites\u2019 privacy policies before submitting Personal Information there.Please also note that Imagine Learning content may be included on web pages and websites that are not associated with us and over which we have no control. These third parties may independently collect data. Imagine Learning is not responsible or liable for the privacy practices or business practices of any third party.Access through a Mobile Device.If you use our Services through a mobile device or one of our mobile applications, you agree that Imagine Learning may store and use that information for security purposes (for example, for user verification or authentication and to ensure that our APIs are being used appropriately.).Students may have the option to log in with a QR code from their teacher. Scanning the QR code requires use of camera. All the processing happens through the LEA. No video is transmitted or stored on our servers. Students may be able to record themselves use the device\u2019s microphone during certain educational activities. These recordings are processed and stored on our servers. Permission is obtained prior to access to the device\u2019s camera or microphone.Children\u2019s Information.Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important to Imagine Learning. For that reason, we created certain features designed to help protect Personal Information relating to children who are less than 13 years of age (or higher age if required by applicable law) ('Child Users').The Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act ('COPPA') requires that all online service providers, including Imagine Learning, obtain parental consent before knowingly collecting personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13. Imagine Learning does not knowingly collect or solicit any personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13, and instead relies upon information provided to Imagine Learning by the account holder. Children under the age of 13 are prohibited from using the Services or creating an account unless they are doing so with parental consent or with the consent of an account holder who is providing such consent in compliance with COPPA. If we learn that we have collected personal information from a person under the age of 13 that does not comply with COPPA, we will delete that information in a reasonably prudent amount of time. If you believe that a child under the age of 13 has provided personally identifiable information to us without appropriate consent, please contact us at privacy@imaginelearning.com.How does a child register and use the Services.Child Users cannot obtain a user account without it being created by a teacher or other LEA-authorized representative.What children\u2019s information is visible to others.No student\u2019s profile is made available or visible to the public through Imagine Learning. If a teacher utilizes certain features on a device in the classroom, other students may be able to view information that is displayed by the teacher in the classroom, but students can\u2019t view each other\u2019s individual student profiles.Parents: To review your child\u2019s user data you must request the information from your child\u2019s teacher. Some Services may allow a LEA to create a parent account tied to their respective students. In such cases, a parent may access their child\u2019s information through the parent account.Our Security Practices.We strive to protect the confidentiality, security, and integrity of the Personal Information we collect from children and adults. We have put in place physical, electronic, and administrative procedures designed to safeguard and to help prevent unauthorized access to and maintain the security of personally identifiable information collected through our Services.All accounts are protected by passwords. Please keep these passwords secret to prevent unauthorized access to these accounts. If you think someone has gained unauthorized access to an account please change your password and contact us immediately.We take customary and reasonable measures designed to protect the confidentiality, security, and integrity of Personal Information collected on our Services, both during transmission and within our systems. Such protections include, but are not limited to:.Data encryption and storage: Data is encrypted in transit (SSL/TLS) and at rest. Personal Information is stored and processed within the continental United States.Access: Access to Personal Information is restricted to a limited number of Imagine Learning employees who need such access to perform their job.Data Systems Monitoring: We employ several third-party services that continuously monitor and scan our Services for vulnerabilities. Employees dedicated to operating the Services monitor these reports and receive automated alerts when performance falls outside of prescribed norms.Incident Response Plan: Imagine Learning maintains an incident response plan.Firewalls: Anti-virus software and firewalls are installed and configured to prevent malicious or unauthorized traffic.Security audits: Imagine Learning conducts security audits and code reviews, both by external and internal providers.Employee training: Imagine Learning has designated privacy and data security officials to oversee employee security training and compliance.Data Breach or Security Incident.While we have taken customary and reasonable steps to protect the Personal Information we collect, no system is 100% fail-proof and secure.In the event that Imagine Learning becomes aware of a data breach impacting your Personal Information, we will provide notification in compliance with all applicable laws and our contracts with LEAs. For example, we may post a notice on our landing page or elsewhere on our Services and may send an email to you at the email address you have provided to us. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing.Imagine Learning has procedures in place that are designed to stop threats that may expose Personal Information, restore the Sites to full functionality, and document and take proactive steps to ensure the incident cannot be repeated. Imagine Learning will also preserve necessary evidence for investigation by security professionals and law enforcement as appropriate. In the unlikely event of an unauthorized disclosure of records, Imagine Learning will follow its internal procedures, that articulate how to report the problem to internal and external stakeholders. The notification process includes any information that can identify which customers and students may have been impacted, the data that may have been accessed, Imagine Learning\u2019s process to inform affected customers, and steps to prevent the incident from happening again as appropriate.In the unlikely event of an unauthorized disclosure of Data, Imagine Learning has implemented a process for responding to incidents and notifying affected individuals and, if applicable, law enforcement personnel.If you have any questions about security on our Services, you can email us by clicking here or emailing privacy@imaginelearning.com directly.Your Choices Related to Your Privacy.In order to process your information, we rely on your consent or our legitimate interests to process your data. You may withdraw your consent or object to the use of our information at any time, but you may no longer be able to access our Services.Communications from Imagine Learning.Imagine Learning may send you information by email or may post notices on the Imagine Learning homepage (https://imaginelearning.com).You may choose to stop receiving certain emails from Imagine Learning by using the unsubscribe button at the bottom of the Imagine Learning email. You may still receive transactional emails from us related to forgotten passwords, account expiration, or other necessary communication. However, we reserve the right to send you information on our behalf and on behalf of third parties in connection with providing our Services. If you no longer want to receive information from us, you will need to close your account.How You Can Delete or Correct Student Information or an Account.When LEAs create accounts for students, teachers, and parents, the LEA remains the sole owner of the educational data. All requests to review, delete or correct student or teacher information should be directed to the LEA. If we receive a request to delete or correct a user\u2019s data from a student, parent, or guardian, we will route such request to the LEA and will assist the LEA as needed to respond to authorized requests within a reasonable time frame and in compliance with applicable laws and regulations.If a LEA requests deletion of data under the control of the LEA, we will promptly delete it, subject to any legal requirement to retain or transfer that data. Note that even following such deletion requests we may store secure backups until they are deleted in accordance with our document retention policy. We may also preserve information as part of an investigation into violations of the law or our terms of use.Please note that any information you share with others on the website or content other users may have copied is not a part of your account and may not be deleted when you delete your account. If we share your data with one of our service providers, we will use our best efforts to cause such third party to delete such data when you delete your account.How We Retain and Delete Your Data.Upon termination of your account, Imagine Learning will take commercially reasonable steps to delete any Personal Information from its live databases in a reasonable amount of time. We will retain Personal Information collected in connection with an account only for as long as is necessary to provide the services to the account holder, as required by applicable laws or regulations or otherwise per the terms or a contract with a LEA.Data may be returned to the LEA as directed by the agreement with the LEA. If no specific instructions are included in the agreement, the data will be returned or destroyed upon one of the following (i) after termination of our relationship with a LEA or LEA-authorized person, (ii) when it is no longer needed for the purpose for which it was provided, (iii) when advised to do so by the LEA, or (iv) as directed by agreement with the LEA. Data are returned in a digital, machine-readable format via a secure means of transmission.We may further retain information for business practices based on our legitimate interest or legal purposes, such as secure electronic archives that are not readily accessible to users or maintained for disaster recovery and/or information technology backups. We may also maintain De-Identified Data, including usage data, for any purpose that is consistent with laws, regulations, and contractual obligations.Even if your account is closed, information may remain in backup or archive records and we may retain certain data relevant to preventing fraud or future abuse or for legitimate business purposes, such as analysis of aggregated, non-personally-identifiable or De-Identified Data, account recovery, or if required by law. All retained data will continue to be subject to the applicable privacy policy for the Service.Users in California.If you are a resident of the state of California, you have certain data protection rights.

BY USING ANY SERVICE, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THIS PRIVACY POLICY IN ITS ENTIRETY.Information Collection/How we use your information: We primarily use the information we collect when you use the Services in connection with your relationship with Imagine Learning, your use of the Services, and for sending you information from us.Information Sharing: Remember that if you create an account or share Personal Information with other users on the Services, your information may be visible to others. However, student data will only be visible to their administrators, teachers and parents, and students cannot share data with other students. Note that we do not share your Personal Information with third parties for their marketing purposes; however, we may share your Personal Information under certain limited circumstances.Third party analytics providers: We work with analytics service providers and other vendors to provide us with information regarding traffic on our websites or through our service (collectively referred to as 'Sites'), including the pages viewed and the actions users take when visiting the Sites and to provide us with information regarding the use of the Sites.How Are Accounts Created.Users must create an Imagine Learning account to access certain portions of our site. The use of the Imagine Learning website is contingent on our processing of your Personal Information as set forth in this Privacy Policy. By creating an account and/or using the website, you are consenting to such practices. If you do not consent to our processing of your Personal Information as set forth in this Privacy Policy, you should not use our website.When LEAs purchase licenses, Imagine Learning creates an organization in the product and grants administrative access to that organization through a primary account. The LEA then enrolls students and teachers/administrators into schools and classrooms and creates accounts on their behalf. When the LEA creates student accounts, they are acting on behalf of parents to give Imagine Learning permission to collect the information described in this Privacy Policy, and Imagine Learning is acting as a service provider to the LEA.When the primary account belongs to a LEA, student accounts will be populated in coordination with that LEA. Students will then be provided login information in a manner specific to that district and in accordance with LEA policy, which may in some cases be through a LEA-wide 'single sign-on' or by communicating an initial login and password to the student.Some Services may also allow a LEA to create a parent account tied to a student account if so desired.Consent by LEAs, Teachers, and Parents.If you are a student of any age, you must get permission from your LEA or LEA-authorized representative to use the Services.Imagine Learning Services are not offered directly to students on any basis, and LEAs must first sign up for primary accounts, and then invite students, teachers, and parents to use Imagine Learning through the accounts they create. LEAs that have obtained licenses must provide consent on behalf of students for Imagine Learning to collect and use student data described in this Privacy Policy and opt to allow for student account creation.What Information Does Imagine Learning Collect About Students, Teachers, and Parents.Information shared with us: We may collect 'Personal Information' (which is information that can reasonably be used, alone or in combination with other reasonably available information, to identify or contact a specific individual). Personal Information includes, but is not limited to, student data, metadata, and user content. The information that we collect from logged-in users includes information that you voluntarily provide to us when you use your account and information that is automatically collected when you are logged into the Imagine Learning platform. The information collected depends on whether you are a teacher, LEA, parent, or student and may vary slightly from product to product. Below is a list of information collected across all our Services.Student Account:.Required student information.Student first and last name.Grade level.Language.Student number.Student username and password for our Services.LEA name.Information provided through use of our Services:.Assessment results and scores including academic performance and placement, psychographic information, and screening results.Curriculum progress.Audio recordings.Student-generated content (e.g., responses to writing prompts and math journals).Communications (such as chat text logs between students and certified teachers, grade commentary, etc.).Certificates of achievement and curriculum completion.Optional student information (Note that we will never condition a student\u2019s participation in an activity on the student\u2019s disclosure of more Personal Information than is necessary to participate in the activity).Single sign-on ID (for schools that use a single sign-on functionality).Demographic information (such as date of birth, gender, ethnicity/race, language).Special indicators (such as Individual Education Plan (IEP) status, English-Language Learner (ELL) status, living situations (foster care/homeless), low-income status etc.).Organization number (e.g., school or district identifier, state identification, or other number).Student email.Teacher/Administrator Account:.Teacher/Administrator first and last name.Teacher/Administrator title.Email address.LEA name.State.Teacher/Administrator username and password for our Services.Single sign-on ID (for schools that use a single sign-on functionality).Certificates of completion for online training.Parent Account (optional):.Parent first and last name.Email address.Parent username and password for our Services.Information collected from our marketing website: Independent of our Services used by students and teachers, we have websites limited to those browsing our marketing content. Our marketing websites collect some data, such as name and contact information, via online forms and some data via cookies and other social media trackers used on marketing pages.Information received from third parties: Third parties may provide us with information about you. For example, if you are on a third-party website, and opt-in to receive information from us, that third party will forward information to us so that we may contact you as requested. Any personal information received from these third parties will be handled in accordance with this Privacy Policy and our agreements with these parties. We sometimes combine information we receive from third parties with the personal information we collect through the Services. Any such combined information will be treated as Personal Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.Information we collect automatically: In every case we also log certain detailed technical information about all users\u2019 interactions with our Services that could be linked with users (including students). This includes the IP addresses that we get when users connect to our Services, information that is sent by web browsers automatically when they connect to our Services (such as the type of web browser, the operating system used and the time zone set on the user\u2019s computer), and the timing and frequency of how users interact with different content and different areas of our Sites.We use following methods and tools to collect and track the automatically collected information described above:.Cookies: Like many other websites and apps, we set cookies so that we may recognize when someone connecting to our Sites is currently logged in or has visited before. A cookie is a data file sent to a browser from a web server and stored on the user\u2019s computer\u2019s hard drive that allows us to recognize that browser when the user returns to our Sites. To learn more about browser cookies, including how to manage or delete them, look in the Tools, Help or similar section of your browser, or visit http://www.allaboutcookies.org.How we respond to Do Not Track signals: Please note that your browser setting may allow you to automatically transmit a 'Do Not Track' (DNT) signal to websites and online service you visit. DNT is a privacy preference users can set in certain web browsers to inform websites and services that they do not want certain information about their webpage visits collected over time and across websites or online services. However, we do not recognize or respond to browser-initiated DNT signals, as the internet industry is still working to determine what DNT means, how to comply with DNT, and how to create a common approach to responding to DNT. To find out more about 'Do Not Track', please visit http://www.allaboutdnt.com.Like most online services, when you use the Services, we automatically collect and store details of how you used our service, such as your activity on the Services, and the frequency and duration of your visits.By using our Services you agree to our use of these information collection technologies.De-identified and Aggregate Data.We frequently aggregate information in a way that is designed to make it impracticable to use that data to identify a particular person. We also sometimes maintain individual data records with personal identifiers removed in a manner that is impracticable to relink it to any specific individual. In this Privacy Policy, we refer to such data as 'De-Identified Data' and do not consider it to be Personal Information. We do not attempt to re-identify information that has been de-identified.What Student Information Can Other Users See.When the primary account belongs to a LEA, the account administrator designated by the LEA can access all information we collect about students that we make available through our websites and online services. LEA-designated administrators can delegate the right to view student information in accordance with LEA policy. Each teacher within that LEA can see only information relating to students\u2019 participation in classes taught by that teacher (unless granted additional access by the LEA account administrator).Some Services may allow a LEA to create a parent account tied to a student account if so desired. Parents may view student information only for the student accounts to which they\u2019ve been linked.What Does Imagine Learning Do With Personal Information.We will not share Personal Information we collect in any way not described by this Privacy Policy. Except as noted below, we do not share any Personal Information with third parties for advertising, marketing, or other purposes. There is no third-party advertising on Imagine Learning. We do not amass student profiles except in the furtherance of school purposes. We do not ask or require students to provide information beyond that which is reasonably necessary to provide the Services. Except in limited instances to provide support services under an agreement, we do not share any student login information with any third party, and we do not automatically collect Personal Information from student accounts. Information collected from students is never used or disclosed for any third-party advertising or any kind of behaviorally targeted advertising. We do not market to or survey students; however, students may choose to provide ratings and other feedback about their experience with learning activities. LEA staff may be invited to provide feedback about their experiences, but participation is never required. Students are occasionally asked to provide feedback on their enjoyment level of various aspects of the Services.We do collect website usage information through third-party analytics services and anonymized data to help us improve our experiences for students, but such information does not contain Personal Information. We also collect website usage information through third-party analytics services for non-student users to support product support and development.We use Personal Information and any other information collected through the website for the following reasons:.to administer the Services;.to improve the quality and types of services that we deliver;.to analyze usage of the Services and the popularity and performance of our Sites;.to communicate with parents, teachers and LEAs by responding to your requests, comments and questions;.to track and assess student development and progress;.to generate reports that allow parents, teachers, and other authorized persons to evaluate student progress, identify students who need intervention, and discover students who can be taught together as a group;.to diagnose technical problems;.to email parents, teachers, and other authorized persons regarding service, technical and other administrative matters. These communications may also include information regarding changes in services, new service offerings and important service-related notices, such as security and fraud notices. Such communications will only be delivered to parents, teachers and LEAs and will never be delivered to student users;.to send users alerts to notify them about pertinent activity on our Services, such as messages from colleagues or upcoming assignments ('Notification Alerts'). These Notification Alerts may be sent to all users of our Services, including students;.to provide useful analyses to users and primary account owners;.to conduct research and analytics to improve our Services and value to you, and to perform research for authorized persons;.to protect Imagine Learning and our users, such as conducting audits or notifying LEAs of inappropriate or potentially harmful behavior;.to assist students who request online help from our state-certified, security-cleared teachers who are employed by Imagine Learning to provide individualized instruction;.for other educational purposes requested and sanctioned by an authorized representative of the LEA;.for billing, account management, and other administrative matters;.to comply with a judicial order, subpoena or other legal request; or.as required by applicable law or regulation.Third Parties.How We Share Information.We use third-party service providers to provide a variety of services, such as assisting us with providing customer support, hosting our Services, providing us with analytics about how people use our Services, assisting us with marketing our Services to LEA administrators and teachers, sending and tracking responses to email, providing a framework for the delivery of assessment tools and analytics, storing data, providing single sign-on services (where applicable), and helping us identify and track bugs and errors in our Services. Student analytics data are anonymous, but teacher analytics data include teacher name and email address. Third parties we work with are contractually prohibited from using any Personal Information for any purpose other than providing the services we request from them.When a LEA is the primary account holder, we share information with third parties at the direction of the LEA, and it is the LEA\u2019s responsibility to make such requests in a manner that is consistent with their internal policies and the law. We may also share information that we collect in the following (or comparable) circumstances:.if we believe in good faith that it is necessary to disclose the information under any applicable law or regulation (for example, in response to a court order or a subpoena);.if we believe in good faith that it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person;.to investigate and act upon potential violations of the law or of our terms of service;.to provide information to a claimed owner of intellectual property who claims that content you have provided infringes on their rights;.in response to bankruptcy proceedings;.with teachers (and parents where necessary) so they can see information about their students or children, such as the student\u2019s or child\u2019s name, school affiliation and activity on assignments (including time of activity and any responses to questions, extending to grades for those assignments);.when any user logs into Imagine Learning with a third-party account (such as a ClassLink, Clever, Google or other Learning Management System account), that third party will learn that that user has visited Imagine Learning, and that information will be subject to that third party\u2019s privacy policy and practices;.with third-party products specifically configured by LEAs to interoperate with Imagine Learning;.if the information is De-Identified Data;.with our corporate affiliates, parents, and/or subsidiaries; or.in other circumstances that you expressly consent to.When logged into our Services, users may choose to interact with Google APIs to submit assignments to our learning management system. For example, users may log into their Google Drive account to select files they wish to upload to the Services as work products. As another example, LEAs may choose to integrate our Services with Google Classroom, linking students from our Services to their corresponding accounts in Google Classroom. If configured by the LEA, this can make it easier for students to login to the Services (i.e., Single Sign-On) without entering another username and password. This may also allow scores and grades from our Services to be automatically passed back to Google Classroom, making it easier for teachers to create and assign work, manage scores, and streamline reporting. Imagine Learning\u2019s use and transfer to any other app of information received from Google APIs will adhere to Google API Services User Data Policy, including the Limited Use requirements.We will not sell Personal Information to anyone for monetary compensation. However, we do share Personal Information that could be considered a \u2018sale\u2019 under the California Consumer Privacy Act such as in connection with the sale of Imagine Learning\u2019s equity or assets or a merger of Imagine Learning with another company. Any sale or merger would be conditioned so that such information will continue to be covered by the then-applicable Privacy Policy or a policy at least as robust as such Privacy Policy.If there are changes to this Privacy Policy in the future, LEAs, teachers, and parents may agree to those changes through continued use of the Services or choose to stop using Imagine Learning and we will delete their information and the information about their students.Third Party Content, Links to Other Sites, and Imagine Learning Content Found Outside the Site.Certain content provided through the Services may be hosted and served by third parties. In addition, our Services includes some links to third party sites or content over which Imagine Learning has no control and which are governed by the privacy policies and business practices of those third parties. We are not responsible for the data collection practices on those other sites. We advise you to carefully review those sites\u2019 privacy policies before submitting Personal Information there.Please also note that Imagine Learning content may be included on web pages and websites that are not associated with us and over which we have no control. These third parties may independently collect data. Imagine Learning is not responsible or liable for the privacy practices or business practices of any third party.Access through a Mobile Device.If you use our Services through a mobile device or one of our mobile applications, you agree that Imagine Learning may store and use that information for security purposes (for example, for user verification or authentication and to ensure that our APIs are being used appropriately.).Students may have the option to log in with a QR code from their teacher. Scanning the QR code requires use of camera. All the processing happens through the LEA. No video is transmitted or stored on our servers. Students may be able to record themselves use the device\u2019s microphone during certain educational activities. These recordings are processed and stored on our servers. Permission is obtained prior to access to the device\u2019s camera or microphone.Children\u2019s Information.Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important to Imagine Learning. For that reason, we created certain features designed to help protect Personal Information relating to children who are less than 13 years of age (or higher age if required by applicable law) ('Child Users').The Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act ('COPPA') requires that all online service providers, including Imagine Learning, obtain parental consent before knowingly collecting personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13. Imagine Learning does not knowingly collect or solicit any personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13, and instead relies upon information provided to Imagine Learning by the account holder. Children under the age of 13 are prohibited from using the Services or creating an account unless they are doing so with parental consent or with the consent of an account holder who is providing such consent in compliance with COPPA. If we learn that we have collected personal information from a person under the age of 13 that does not comply with COPPA, we will delete that information in a reasonably prudent amount of time. If you believe that a child under the age of 13 has provided personally identifiable information to us without appropriate consent, please contact us at privacy@imaginelearning.com.How does a child register and use the Services.Child Users cannot obtain a user account without it being created by a teacher or other LEA-authorized representative.What children\u2019s information is visible to others.No student\u2019s profile is made available or visible to the public through Imagine Learning. If a teacher utilizes certain features on a device in the classroom, other students may be able to view information that is displayed by the teacher in the classroom, but students can\u2019t view each other\u2019s individual student profiles.Parents: To review your child\u2019s user data you must request the information from your child\u2019s teacher. Some Services may allow a LEA to create a parent account tied to their respective students. In such cases, a parent may access their child\u2019s information through the parent account.Our Security Practices.We strive to protect the confidentiality, security, and integrity of the Personal Information we collect from children and adults. We have put in place physical, electronic, and administrative procedures designed to safeguard and to help prevent unauthorized access to and maintain the security of personally identifiable information collected through our Services.All accounts are protected by passwords. Please keep these passwords secret to prevent unauthorized access to these accounts. If you think someone has gained unauthorized access to an account please change your password and contact us immediately.We take customary and reasonable measures designed to protect the confidentiality, security, and integrity of Personal Information collected on our Services, both during transmission and within our systems. Such protections include, but are not limited to:.Data encryption and storage: Data is encrypted in transit (SSL/TLS) and at rest. Personal Information is stored and processed within the continental United States.Access: Access to Personal Information is restricted to a limited number of Imagine Learning employees who need such access to perform their job.Data Systems Monitoring: We employ several third-party services that continuously monitor and scan our Services for vulnerabilities. Employees dedicated to operating the Services monitor these reports and receive automated alerts when performance falls outside of prescribed norms.Incident Response Plan: Imagine Learning maintains an incident response plan.Firewalls: Anti-virus software and firewalls are installed and configured to prevent malicious or unauthorized traffic.Security audits: Imagine Learning conducts security audits and code reviews, both by external and internal providers.Employee training: Imagine Learning has designated privacy and data security officials to oversee employee security training and compliance.Data Breach or Security Incident.While we have taken customary and reasonable steps to protect the Personal Information we collect, no system is 100% fail-proof and secure.In the event that Imagine Learning becomes aware of a data breach impacting your Personal Information, we will provide notification in compliance with all applicable laws and our contracts with LEAs. For example, we may post a notice on our landing page or elsewhere on our Services and may send an email to you at the email address you have provided to us. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing.Imagine Learning has procedures in place that are designed to stop threats that may expose Personal Information, restore the Sites to full functionality, and document and take proactive steps to ensure the incident cannot be repeated. Imagine Learning will also preserve necessary evidence for investigation by security professionals and law enforcement as appropriate. In the unlikely event of an unauthorized disclosure of records, Imagine Learning will follow its internal procedures, that articulate how to report the problem to internal and external stakeholders. The notification process includes any information that can identify which customers and students may have been impacted, the data that may have been accessed, Imagine Learning\u2019s process to inform affected customers, and steps to prevent the incident from happening again as appropriate.In the unlikely event of an unauthorized disclosure of Data, Imagine Learning has implemented a process for responding to incidents and notifying affected individuals and, if applicable, law enforcement personnel.If you have any questions about security on our Services, you can email us by clicking here or emailing privacy@imaginelearning.com directly.Your Choices Related to Your Privacy.In order to process your information, we rely on your consent or our legitimate interests to process your data. You may withdraw your consent or object to the use of our information at any time, but you may no longer be able to access our Services.Communications from Imagine Learning.Imagine Learning may send you information by email or may post notices on the Imagine Learning homepage (https://imaginelearning.com).You may choose to stop receiving certain emails from Imagine Learning by using the unsubscribe button at the bottom of the Imagine Learning email. You may still receive transactional emails from us related to forgotten passwords, account expiration, or other necessary communication. However, we reserve the right to send you information on our behalf and on behalf of third parties in connection with providing our Services. If you no longer want to receive information from us, you will need to close your account.How You Can Delete or Correct Student Information or an Account.When LEAs create accounts for students, teachers, and parents, the LEA remains the sole owner of the educational data. All requests to review, delete or correct student or teacher information should be directed to the LEA. If we receive a request to delete or correct a user\u2019s data from a student, parent, or guardian, we will route such request to the LEA and will assist the LEA as needed to respond to authorized requests within a reasonable time frame and in compliance with applicable laws and regulations.If a LEA requests deletion of data under the control of the LEA, we will promptly delete it, subject to any legal requirement to retain or transfer that data. Note that even following such deletion requests we may store secure backups until they are deleted in accordance with our document retention policy. We may also preserve information as part of an investigation into violations of the law or our terms of use.Please note that any information you share with others on the website or content other users may have copied is not a part of your account and may not be deleted when you delete your account. If we share your data with one of our service providers, we will use our best efforts to cause such third party to delete such data when you delete your account.How We Retain and Delete Your Data.Upon termination of your account, Imagine Learning will take commercially reasonable steps to delete any Personal Information from its live databases in a reasonable amount of time. We will retain Personal Information collected in connection with an account only for as long as is necessary to provide the services to the account holder, as required by applicable laws or regulations or otherwise per the terms or a contract with a LEA.Data may be returned to the LEA as directed by the agreement with the LEA. If no specific instructions are included in the agreement, the data will be returned or destroyed upon one of the following (i) after termination of our relationship with a LEA or LEA-authorized person, (ii) when it is no longer needed for the purpose for which it was provided, (iii) when advised to do so by the LEA, or (iv) as directed by agreement with the LEA. Data are returned in a digital, machine-readable format via a secure means of transmission.We may further retain information for business practices based on our legitimate interest or legal purposes, such as secure electronic archives that are not readily accessible to users or maintained for disaster recovery and/or information technology backups. We may also maintain De-Identified Data, including usage data, for any purpose that is consistent with laws, regulations, and contractual obligations.Even if your account is closed, information may remain in backup or archive records and we may retain certain data relevant to preventing fraud or future abuse or for legitimate business purposes, such as analysis of aggregated, non-personally-identifiable or De-Identified Data, account recovery, or if required by law. All retained data will continue to be subject to the applicable privacy policy for the Service.Users in California.If you are a resident of the state of California, you have certain data protection rights.

This section describes how we collect, use, and share Personal Information of California residents in operating our business and their rights with respect to that Personal Information.

PLEASE READ THE ENTIRE PRIVACY POLICY VERY CAREFULLY. BY USING ANY SERVICE, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THIS PRIVACY POLICY IN ITS ENTIRETY. Information Collection/How we use your information: We primarily use the information we collect when you use the Services in connection with your relationship with Imagine Learning, your use of the Services, and for sending you information from us. Information Sharing: Remember that if you create an account or share Personal Information with other users on the Services, your information may be visible to others.

If you do not consent to our processing of your Personal Information as set forth in this Privacy Policy, you should not use our website. When LEAs purchase licenses, Imagine Learning creates an organization in the product and grants administrative access to that organization through a primary account. The LEA then enrolls students and teachers/administrators into schools and classrooms and creates accounts on their behalf. When the LEA creates student accounts, they are acting on behalf of parents to give Imagine Learning permission to collect the information described in this Privacy Policy, and Imagine Learning is acting as a service provider to the LEA. When the primary account belongs to a LEA, student accounts will be populated in coordination with that LEA. Students will then be provided login information in a manner specific to that district and in accordance with LEA policy, which may in some cases be through a LEA-wide 'single sign-on' or by communicating an initial login and password to the student. Some Services may also allow a LEA to create a parent account tied to a student account if so desired. If you are a student of any age, you must get permission from your LEA or LEA-authorized representative to use the Services. Imagine Learning Services are not offered directly to students on any basis, and LEAs must first sign up for primary accounts, and then invite students, teachers, and parents to use Imagine Learning through the accounts they create. LEAs that have obtained licenses must provide consent on behalf of students for Imagine Learning to collect and use student data described in this Privacy Policy and opt to allow for student account creation. Information shared with us: We may collect 'Personal Information' (which is information that can reasonably be used, alone or in combination with other reasonably available information, to identify or contact a specific individual). Personal Information includes, but is not limited to, student data, metadata, and user content. The information that we collect from logged-in users includes information that you voluntarily provide to us when you use your account and information that is automatically collected when you are logged into the Imagine Learning platform.

Our marketing websites collect some data, such as name and contact information, via online forms and some data via cookies and other social media trackers used on marketing pages. Information received from third parties: Third parties may provide us with information about you. For example, if you are on a third-party website, and opt-in to receive information from us, that third party will forward information to us so that we may contact you as requested. Any personal information received from these third parties will be handled in accordance with this Privacy Policy and our agreements with these parties. We sometimes combine information we receive from third parties with the personal information we collect through the Services. Any such combined information will be treated as Personal Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Information we collect automatically: In every case we also log certain detailed technical information about all users\u2019 interactions with our Services that could be linked with users (including students). This includes the IP addresses that we get when users connect to our Services, information that is sent by web browsers automatically when they connect to our Services (such as the type of web browser, the operating system used and the time zone set on the user\u2019s computer), and the timing and frequency of how users interact with different content and different areas of our Sites. We use following methods and tools to collect and track the automatically collected information described above: Cookies: Like many other websites and apps, we set cookies so that we may recognize when someone connecting to our Sites is currently logged in or has visited before. A cookie is a data file sent to a browser from a web server and stored on the user\u2019s computer\u2019s hard drive that allows us to recognize that browser when the user returns to our Sites. To learn more about browser cookies, including how to manage or delete them, look in the Tools, Help or similar section of your browser, or visit http://www.allaboutcookies.org.How we respond to Do Not Track signals: Please note that your browser setting may allow you to automatically transmit a 'Do Not Track' (DNT) signal to websites and online service you visit. DNT is a privacy preference users can set in certain web browsers to inform websites and services that they do not want certain information about their webpage visits collected over time and across websites or online services. However, we do not recognize or respond to browser-initiated DNT signals, as the internet industry is still working to determine what DNT means, how to comply with DNT, and how to create a common approach to responding to DNT. To find out more about 'Do Not Track', please visit http://www.allaboutdnt.com.

Like most online services, when you use the Services, we automatically collect and store details of how you used our service, such as your activity on the Services, and the frequency and duration of your visits. By using our Services you agree to our use of these information collection technologies. We frequently aggregate information in a way that is designed to make it impracticable to use that data to identify a particular person. We also sometimes maintain individual data records with personal identifiers removed in a manner that is impracticable to relink it to any specific individual. In this Privacy Policy, we refer to such data as 'De-Identified Data' and do not consider it to be Personal Information. We do not attempt to re-identify information that has been de-identified. When the primary account belongs to a LEA, the account administrator designated by the LEA can access all information we collect about students that we make available through our websites and online services. LEA-designated administrators can delegate the right to view student information in accordance with LEA policy. Each teacher within that LEA can see only information relating to students\u2019 participation in classes taught by that teacher (unless granted additional access by the LEA account administrator). Some Services may allow a LEA to create a parent account tied to a student account if so desired. Parents may view student information only for the student accounts to which they\u2019ve been linked. We will not share Personal Information we collect in any way not described by this Privacy Policy. Except as noted below, we do not share any Personal Information with third parties for advertising, marketing, or other purposes. There is no third-party advertising on Imagine Learning. We do not amass student profiles except in the furtherance of school purposes. We do not ask or require students to provide information beyond that which is reasonably necessary to provide the Services. Except in limited instances to provide support services under an agreement, we do not share any student login information with any third party, and we do not automatically collect Personal Information from student accounts. Information collected from students is never used or disclosed for any third-party advertising or any kind of behaviorally targeted advertising. We do not market to or survey students; however, students may choose to provide ratings and other feedback about their experience with learning activities. LEA staff may be invited to provide feedback about their experiences, but participation is never required. Students are occasionally asked to provide feedback on their enjoyment level of various aspects of the Services. We do collect website usage information through third-party analytics services and anonymized data to help us improve our experiences for students, but such information does not contain Personal Information. We also collect website usage information through third-party analytics services for non-student users to support product support and development. We use Personal Information and any other information collected through the website for the following reasons: to administer the Services;.to improve the quality and types of services that we deliver;.to analyze usage of the Services and the popularity and performance of our Sites;.to communicate with parents, teachers and LEAs by responding to your requests, comments and questions;.to track and assess student development and progress;.to generate reports that allow parents, teachers, and other authorized persons to evaluate student progress, identify students who need intervention, and discover students who can be taught together as a group;.to diagnose technical problems;.to email parents, teachers, and other authorized persons regarding service, technical and other administrative matters. These communications may also include information regarding changes in services, new service offerings and important service-related notices, such as security and fraud notices. Such communications will only be delivered to parents, teachers and LEAs and will never be delivered to student users;.to send users alerts to notify them about pertinent activity on our Services, such as messages from colleagues or upcoming assignments ('Notification Alerts'). These Notification Alerts may be sent to all users of our Services, including students;.to provide useful analyses to users and primary account owners;.to conduct research and analytics to improve our Services and value to you, and to perform research for authorized persons;.to protect Imagine Learning and our users, such as conducting audits or notifying LEAs of inappropriate or potentially harmful behavior;.to assist students who request online help from our state-certified, security-cleared teachers who are employed by Imagine Learning to provide individualized instruction;.for other educational purposes requested and sanctioned by an authorized representative of the LEA;.for billing, account management, and other administrative matters;.to comply with a judicial order, subpoena or other legal request; or.as required by applicable law or regulation. to administer the Services; to improve the quality and types of services that we deliver; to analyze usage of the Services and the popularity and performance of our Sites; to communicate with parents, teachers and LEAs by responding to your requests, comments and questions; to track and assess student development and progress; to generate reports that allow parents, teachers, and other authorized persons to evaluate student progress, identify students who need intervention, and discover students who can be taught together as a group; to diagnose technical problems; to email parents, teachers, and other authorized persons regarding service, technical and other administrative matters.

We use third-party service providers to provide a variety of services, such as assisting us with providing customer support, hosting our Services, providing us with analytics about how people use our Services, assisting us with marketing our Services to LEA administrators and teachers, sending and tracking responses to email, providing a framework for the delivery of assessment tools and analytics, storing data, providing single sign-on services (where applicable), and helping us identify and track bugs and errors in our Services. Student analytics data are anonymous, but teacher analytics data include teacher name and email address. Third parties we work with are contractually prohibited from using any Personal Information for any purpose other than providing the services we request from them. When a LEA is the primary account holder, we share information with third parties at the direction of the LEA, and it is the LEA\u2019s responsibility to make such requests in a manner that is consistent with their internal policies and the law. We may also share information that we collect in the following (or comparable) circumstances: if we believe in good faith that it is necessary to disclose the information under any applicable law or regulation (for example, in response to a court order or a subpoena);.if we believe in good faith that it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person;.to investigate and act upon potential violations of the law or of our terms of service;.to provide information to a claimed owner of intellectual property who claims that content you have provided infringes on their rights;.in response to bankruptcy proceedings;.with teachers (and parents where necessary) so they can see information about their students or children, such as the student\u2019s or child\u2019s name, school affiliation and activity on assignments (including time of activity and any responses to questions, extending to grades for those assignments);.when any user logs into Imagine Learning with a third-party account (such as a ClassLink, Clever, Google or other Learning Management System account), that third party will learn that that user has visited Imagine Learning, and that information will be subject to that third party\u2019s privacy policy and practices;.with third-party products specifically configured by LEAs to interoperate with Imagine Learning;.if the information is De-Identified Data;.with our corporate affiliates, parents, and/or subsidiaries; or.in other circumstances that you expressly consent to. if we believe in good faith that it is necessary to disclose the information under any applicable law or regulation (for example, in response to a court order or a subpoena); if we believe in good faith that it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person; to investigate and act upon potential violations of the law or of our terms of service; to provide information to a claimed owner of intellectual property who claims that content you have provided infringes on their rights; in response to bankruptcy proceedings; with teachers (and parents where necessary) so they can see information about their students or children, such as the student\u2019s or child\u2019s name, school affiliation and activity on assignments (including time of activity and any responses to questions, extending to grades for those assignments); when any user logs into Imagine Learning with a third-party account (such as a ClassLink, Clever, Google or other Learning Management System account), that third party will learn that that user has visited Imagine Learning, and that information will be subject to that third party\u2019s privacy policy and practices; with third-party products specifically configured by LEAs to interoperate with Imagine Learning; if the information is De-Identified Data; with our corporate affiliates, parents, and/or subsidiaries; or in other circumstances that you expressly consent to. When logged into our Services, users may choose to interact with Google APIs to submit assignments to our learning management system. For example, users may log into their Google Drive account to select files they wish to upload to the Services as work products. As another example, LEAs may choose to integrate our Services with Google Classroom, linking students from our Services to their corresponding accounts in Google Classroom. If configured by the LEA, this can make it easier for students to login to the Services (i.e., Single Sign-On) without entering another username and password. This may also allow scores and grades from our Services to be automatically passed back to Google Classroom, making it easier for teachers to create and assign work, manage scores, and streamline reporting. Imagine Learning\u2019s use and transfer to any other app of information received from Google APIs will adhere to Google API Services User Data Policy, including the Limited Use requirements. We will not sell Personal Information to anyone for monetary compensation. However, we do share Personal Information that could be considered a \u2018sale\u2019 under the California Consumer Privacy Act such as in connection with the sale of Imagine Learning\u2019s equity or assets or a merger of Imagine Learning with another company. Any sale or merger would be conditioned so that such information will continue to be covered by the then-applicable Privacy Policy or a policy at least as robust as such Privacy Policy. If there are changes to this Privacy Policy in the future, LEAs, teachers, and parents may agree to those changes through continued use of the Services or choose to stop using Imagine Learning and we will delete their information and the information about their students. Certain content provided through the Services may be hosted and served by third parties. In addition, our Services includes some links to third party sites or content over which Imagine Learning has no control and which are governed by the privacy policies and business practices of those third parties. We are not responsible for the data collection practices on those other sites. We advise you to carefully review those sites\u2019 privacy policies before submitting Personal Information there. Please also note that Imagine Learning content may be included on web pages and websites that are not associated with us and over which we have no control. These third parties may independently collect data. Imagine Learning is not responsible or liable for the privacy practices or business practices of any third party. If you use our Services through a mobile device or one of our mobile applications, you agree that Imagine Learning may store and use that information for security purposes (for example, for user verification or authentication and to ensure that our APIs are being used appropriately.) Students may have the option to log in with a QR code from their teacher. Scanning the QR code requires use of camera. All the processing happens through the LEA. No video is transmitted or stored on our servers. Students may be able to record themselves use the device\u2019s microphone during certain educational activities. These recordings are processed and stored on our servers. Permission is obtained prior to access to the device\u2019s camera or microphone. Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important to Imagine Learning. For that reason, we created certain features designed to help protect Personal Information relating to children who are less than 13 years of age (or higher age if required by applicable law) ('Child Users'). The Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act ('COPPA') requires that all online service providers, including Imagine Learning, obtain parental consent before knowingly collecting personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13. Imagine Learning does not knowingly collect or solicit any personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13, and instead relies upon information provided to Imagine Learning by the account holder. Children under the age of 13 are prohibited from using the Services or creating an account unless they are doing so with parental consent or with the consent of an account holder who is providing such consent in compliance with COPPA. If we learn that we have collected personal information from a person under the age of 13 that does not comply with COPPA, we will delete that information in a reasonably prudent amount of time. If you believe that a child under the age of 13 has provided personally identifiable information to us without appropriate consent, please contact us at privacy@imaginelearning.com. Child Users cannot obtain a user account without it being created by a teacher or other LEA-authorized representative. No student\u2019s profile is made available or visible to the public through Imagine Learning. If a teacher utilizes certain features on a device in the classroom, other students may be able to view information that is displayed by the teacher in the classroom, but students can\u2019t view each other\u2019s individual student profiles. Parents: To review your child\u2019s user data you must request the information from your child\u2019s teacher. Some Services may allow a LEA to create a parent account tied to their respective students. In such cases, a parent may access their child\u2019s information through the parent account. We strive to protect the confidentiality, security, and integrity of the Personal Information we collect from children and adults. We have put in place physical, electronic, and administrative procedures designed to safeguard and to help prevent unauthorized access to and maintain the security of personally identifiable information collected through our Services. All accounts are protected by passwords. Please keep these passwords secret to prevent unauthorized access to these accounts. If you think someone has gained unauthorized access to an account please change your password and contact us immediately. We take customary and reasonable measures designed to protect the confidentiality, security, and integrity of Personal Information collected on our Services, both during transmission and within our systems. Such protections include, but are not limited to: Data encryption and storage: Data is encrypted in transit (SSL/TLS) and at rest. Personal Information is stored and processed within the continental United States.Access: Access to Personal Information is restricted to a limited number of Imagine Learning employees who need such access to perform their job.Data Systems Monitoring: We employ several third-party services that continuously monitor and scan our Services for vulnerabilities. Employees dedicated to operating the Services monitor these reports and receive automated alerts when performance falls outside of prescribed norms.Incident Response Plan: Imagine Learning maintains an incident response plan.Firewalls: Anti-virus software and firewalls are installed and configured to prevent malicious or unauthorized traffic.Security audits: Imagine Learning conducts security audits and code reviews, both by external and internal providers.Employee training: Imagine Learning has designated privacy and data security officials to oversee employee security training and compliance.

Employee training: Imagine Learning has designated privacy and data security officials to oversee employee security training and compliance. While we have taken customary and reasonable steps to protect the Personal Information we collect, no system is 100% fail-proof and secure. In the event that Imagine Learning becomes aware of a data breach impacting your Personal Information, we will provide notification in compliance with all applicable laws and our contracts with LEAs. For example, we may post a notice on our landing page or elsewhere on our Services and may send an email to you at the email address you have provided to us. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing. Imagine Learning has procedures in place that are designed to stop threats that may expose Personal Information, restore the Sites to full functionality, and document and take proactive steps to ensure the incident cannot be repeated. Imagine Learning will also preserve necessary evidence for investigation by security professionals and law enforcement as appropriate. In the unlikely event of an unauthorized disclosure of records, Imagine Learning will follow its internal procedures, that articulate how to report the problem to internal and external stakeholders. The notification process includes any information that can identify which customers and students may have been impacted, the data that may have been accessed, Imagine Learning\u2019s process to inform affected customers, and steps to prevent the incident from happening again as appropriate. In the unlikely event of an unauthorized disclosure of Data, Imagine Learning has implemented a process for responding to incidents and notifying affected individuals and, if applicable, law enforcement personnel. If you have any questions about security on our Services, you can email us by clicking here or emailing privacy@imaginelearning.com directly. In order to process your information, we rely on your consent or our legitimate interests to process your data. You may withdraw your consent or object to the use of our information at any time, but you may no longer be able to access our Services. Imagine Learning may send you information by email or may post notices on the Imagine Learning homepage (https://imaginelearning.com). You may choose to stop receiving certain emails from Imagine Learning by using the unsubscribe button at the bottom of the Imagine Learning email. You may still receive transactional emails from us related to forgotten passwords, account expiration, or other necessary communication. However, we reserve the right to send you information on our behalf and on behalf of third parties in connection with providing our Services. If you no longer want to receive information from us, you will need to close your account. When LEAs create accounts for students, teachers, and parents, the LEA remains the sole owner of the educational data. All requests to review, delete or correct student or teacher information should be directed to the LEA. If we receive a request to delete or correct a user\u2019s data from a student, parent, or guardian, we will route such request to the LEA and will assist the LEA as needed to respond to authorized requests within a reasonable time frame and in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. If a LEA requests deletion of data under the control of the LEA, we will promptly delete it, subject to any legal requirement to retain or transfer that data. Note that even following such deletion requests we may store secure backups until they are deleted in accordance with our document retention policy. We may also preserve information as part of an investigation into violations of the law or our terms of use. Please note that any information you share with others on the website or content other users may have copied is not a part of your account and may not be deleted when you delete your account. If we share your data with one of our service providers, we will use our best efforts to cause such third party to delete such data when you delete your account. Upon termination of your account, Imagine Learning will take commercially reasonable steps to delete any Personal Information from its live databases in a reasonable amount of time. We will retain Personal Information collected in connection with an account only for as long as is necessary to provide the services to the account holder, as required by applicable laws or regulations or otherwise per the terms or a contract with a LEA. Data may be returned to the LEA as directed by the agreement with the LEA. If no specific instructions are included in the agreement, the data will be returned or destroyed upon one of the following (i) after termination of our relationship with a LEA or LEA-authorized person, (ii) when it is no longer needed for the purpose for which it was provided, (iii) when advised to do so by the LEA, or (iv) as directed by agreement with the LEA. Data are returned in a digital, machine-readable format via a secure means of transmission. We may further retain information for business practices based on our legitimate interest or legal purposes, such as secure electronic archives that are not readily accessible to users or maintained for disaster recovery and/or information technology backups. We may also maintain De-Identified Data, including usage data, for any purpose that is consistent with laws, regulations, and contractual obligations. Even if your account is closed, information may remain in backup or archive records and we may retain certain data relevant to preventing fraud or future abuse or for legitimate business purposes, such as analysis of aggregated, non-personally-identifiable or De-Identified Data, account recovery, or if required by law. All retained data will continue to be subject to the applicable privacy policy for the Service. If you are a resident of the state of California, you have certain data protection rights.

Together with Google Analytics, we use cookies and software logs to monitor the use of the Services and to gather non-personal information about visitors to the site. These monitoring systems allow us to track general information about our visitors, such as the type of browsers (for example, Firefox or Internet Explorer), the operating systems (for instance, Windows or Macintosh), or the Internet providers (for instance, Comcast) they use. This information is used for statistical and market research purposes to tailor content to usage patterns and to provide services requested by our customers.We also have implemented certain Google Analytics Advertiser features. These tools use cookies to collect and store standard Internet log and visitor information on our behalf, including information about what pages you visit, how long you are on our sites, how you got here, and what you click on during your visit. This Google Analytics data is not tied to personal information, so this information cannot be used to identify who you are.

Raptive will collect and use certain data for advertising purposes. To learn more about Raptive\u2019s data usage and your related rights, please click here: Raptive\u2019s Advertising Privacy Statement. Raptive\u2019s Consent Management Platform (CMP) is LiveRamp with the CMP identification number 3. We also may work with DigiTrust to set a cookie in your browser to enable us and DigiTrust Partners to collect web viewing data that includes visits to a Britannica Service and other non-affiliated websites over time. This data may be used to infer whether you share interests with other Users and deliver advertising relevant to those inferences. You can exercise choice about the collection of data in this way for interest-based, behavioral advertising by visiting the Digital Advertising Alliance\u2019s choice page and opting out from DigiTrust or use one of the links provided below. Opting out from DigiTrust will stop DigiTrust Partners from using the DigiTrust identifier. Through the DAA choice page, you may make other choices for companies that participate in the DAA, some of which are DigiTrust Partners.Our ad-supported Services and Games may also rely on third-party service providers to do things like: take user-level information, anonymize it through hashing (a hashed email address might look something like this: e820bb4aba5ad74c5a6ff1aca16641f6) and match it against other anonymized, people-based identifiers \u2013 doing this helps us serve you personalized, relevant advertisements. Specifically, when you use our ad-supported Services, we may share information that we may collect from you, including your email (in hashed form), IP address or information about your browser or operating system, with our third-party service providers, Index Exchange (IX) and LiveRamp Inc. and its group companies (\u2018LiveRamp\u2019). IX and LiveRamp may use our first party cookie on your browser to match your shared information to their marketing databases in order to provide back a pseudonymous privacy-centric identifier for our use in real time bidding in digital advertising. These third parties may in turn link further demographic or interest-based information to your browser. You have the choice to opt-out of the use of your data by third-party service providers for this purpose at any time. Please find more information about opting out below.Please note that limiting third-party cookies via your browser controls does not prevent our first-party cookies from being set in this way. Also, please know, if you opt-out of interest-based advertising you will continue to receive ads on our free, ad-supported Services and Games, but not behaviorally targeted ads. Also, if you opt-out of Britannica\u2019s practices, you may continue to receive interest-based advertising through other companies. If you erase your browser\u2019s cookies, you may need to perform this process again.Anonymous dataAnonymous aggregated data may be provided to other companies we do business with for statistical purposes.

When you use a mobile device like a tablet or cell phone to access our Services, we may access and monitor one or more 'device identifiers.' Device identifiers are small data files associated with your mobile device that uniquely identify your mobile device. A device identifier may deliver information to us or a third party partner about how you browse and use the services and may help us or others provide reports or personalized ads. Some features of the services may not function properly if use or availability of device identifiers is impaired or disabled.Third-party activitiesFor our legitimate business interests, and with your consent where this is required, we may process data collected by us for advertising, including interest-based advertising, as described in this section.As described above, in order to monetize our free, ad-supported Services and Games, we work with third-party service providers, advertisers and advertising networks that use cookies and other similar technologies to target ads served to our free, ad-supported Services. Our Privacy Notice does not cover the use of data that you provide directly to advertisers or third-party partners; that usage is governed by the advertiser\u2019s or third party partner\u2019s privacy policy.What does it mean to 'serve ads'. When you visit a website, your Internet browser transmits a 'request' to the computer that hosts the website (the 'host server') requesting that server to send you (or 'serve') the Web page that you are seeking. Most Web pages contain components that are pulled from different sources, for example, a Web page at a news site may get its weather section from one provider, its sports results from a different source, and advertisements from other servers. Our Web pages contain coding that directs your browser to fill the ad spaces on the Web pages with content served by advertisers and advertising networks to whom we have sold the ad spaces. These advertisers and advertising networks use cookies and beacons to help manage ad delivery and frequency and to identify audience segment(s) for customized advertising ('targeting'). These cookies are used to identify your IP address, so that when you visit another website using the same advertising network, the advertising network will recognize the cookie as one of its own, read the information on the cookie (the record of which sites in the network you have visited) and serve you an ad that you might be interested in, based on your past visits to other sites in the network. Advertising targeted based on past Web surfing is known as 'behavioral advertising.'Britannica does not provide any personal information to third-party service providers, such as Raptive, advertisers or advertising networks about visitors to the Services. Our Privacy Notice does not cover the use of information that may have been collected from you by third parties on other websites. If you would like to learn more about behavioral advertising or to opt-out of having this information used by companies that are part of the Network Advertising Initiative to deliver targeted ads, please visit http://www.networkadvertising.org. Many of the same companies are members of the Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising. You can learn more and opt-out of receiving targeted ads from them at http://www.aboutads.info/choices.Some advertising networks require that we specifically list their opt-out links below. When you opt-out of a network, you may receive a 'opt-out' cookie so that the network will know not to assign you new cookies in the future. You will continue to receive ads from that network, but not behaviorally targeted ads. If you erase your browser\u2019s cookies, you may need to perform this process again.Exponential Interactive, Inc. has a legitimate interest to collect and profile personal data in the form of IP address and cookie ID from users on our website in order to provide targeted online advertising and ad measurement. For more details including opt-out requests, access requests, or complaints, please review their privacy policy or contact their data protection officer via [email protected].Your Rights & Choices; Opt-Out ChoicesRaptive\u2019s Advertising Privacy Statement more fully describes the cookies, beacons and other similar technology used on our Services for advertising purposes and provides information on when and how users can accept or reject them. You can opt-out of being behaviorally targeted by Britannica (and other companies employing online advertising) via the following options:Digital Advertising AllianceDigital Advertising Alliance CanadaEuropean Digital Advertising AllianceNetwork Advertising Initiative Please remember, if you opt-out of interest-based advertising you will continue to receive ads on our free, ad-supported Services and Games, but not behaviorally targeted ads.

If the website contains content provided by a third-party website (for example a web measurement tools such as a web beacon or scripts), some information about you may be automatically sent to the content provider. This type of arrangement has several benefits, such as allowing you to access third-party content from our Services conveniently. Some internet browsers or other tools include 'Do Not Track' (DNT) features that, when turned on, send a signal to websites you visit indicating you do not wish to be tracked across websites over time. However, since no technological standard for DNT signals has been developed or adopted to date, our Services do not currently respond to DNT signals.Britannica Kids & Student DataA note to minors: If you are under the age of 16, please get permission from your parent/legal guardian or school before using the Services. If we discover that we have collected any personally identifiable information from a child under the age of 16 without the proper consents required by law, we will suspend the associated account and/or remove that information from our database as soon as possible.Britannica does not knowingly collect or solicit personally identifiable information from or about children under 16, except as permitted by law or otherwise provided herein. If we discover we have received any information from a child under 16 in violation of this policy, we will delete that information immediately. If you believe Britannica has any information from or about anyone under 16, please email us at [email protected].Student DataOur Britannica Education Privacy Policy located at https://corporate.britannica.com/privacy.html, not this Privacy Notice, applies to data processed in connection with an institution\u2019s and its users\u2019 subscription-based use of our Institutional Services.In general, if you are a student with access to our Institutional Services through an Institutional Subscription License Agreement between your school institution and us, your student service data is processed in a way that is COPPA- and FERPA-compliant. As you use the Institutional Services, you may enter student data or interact with student data that has already been entered. Under the terms of our contracts with school institutions, we agree to act as a 'School Official' as defined by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), meaning that we:Perform an institutional service or function for which the school or district would otherwise use its own employees;Have been determined to meet the criteria set forth in the school\u2019s or district\u2019s annual notification of FERPA rights for being a School Official with a legitimate educational interest in the education records;Are under the direct control of the school or district with regard to the use and maintenance of education records; andUse education records only for authorized purposes and will not re-disclose from education records to other parties (unless we have specific authorization from the school or district to do so and it is otherwise permitted by FERPA).However, FERPA requires limitations on disclosure of those records and implementation of appropriate security measures to protect those records. To help your school district comply with FERPA, we have adopted certain practices, and require that educators using this site fulfill certain responsibilities to safeguard student data.The following statement explains our practices and your responsibilities regarding the student data you enter on this site.Student Data Security & Confidentiality StatementPurposes of Data EntryYou control what student data is entered on our Kids\u2019 Service or Institutional Services and you always retain ownership of the student data. Student data entered on this site should be limited to information that is relevant to the legitimate educational purpose of improving student performance. We will not ask you to enter, and you are instructed not to enter, data about students that is not relevant to this legitimate educational purpose.Therefore, only a minimum amount of personally identifiable student data required for the setup of the system is requested. Additional data, not specific to the student, is also required to complete system setup, including the teacher first and last name, class name, grade level, and school name.Use, Disclosure, and StorageWe will use the student data to provide the subscribed-to Institutional Services to your school institution. We will not keep the student data after you or the school district instructs us to delete it.We will only disclose student data to authorized employees or representatives of the school institution and will not knowingly disclose the student data to any third person without express written authorization. When, at the request of the school institution, we acquire assessment or other information, including personally identifiable student data, from a third-party source we treat that information with the same confidentiality and security safeguards as though it were provided directly by the school institution. Additional agreements may be required by the third party to authorize transmission of data to us.Your school institution may from time to time request that we provide student data to third parties of its choosing. We will do so with written authorization, which acknowledges that we are providing that data as the requesting institution\u2019s agent and that once the data is received by the third party, we no longer have any control over the use or disposition of the data.We may also use aggregated data in our research, product development, and marketing. That aggregated, non-personally identifiable data (e.g., summary or statistical data) may be shared with third parties. However, we do not use personally identifiable student data to market any products or services directly to students or their parents.If we wish, from time to time, to release aggregated data that identifies a school or school district by name, we will enter into a separate agreement with the institution to authorize release and publication.We do not utilize third parties to provide products and do not share your student data with any third parties.Security of Your InformationBritannica is committed to keeping your personal information safe and secure. Any personal information collected through the Services is stored on limited-access servers. We maintain a comprehensive information security program and seek to use commercially reasonable organizational, physical, technical and administrative safeguards to protect these servers and the information they store from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, loss or modification. Our security measures include (among others): encryption of data; security controls that protect the entirety of Britannica\u2019s IT infrastructure from external attack and unauthorized access; and internal policies setting out our data security approach and training for employees, including a Data Breach Notification Policy. We update and test our security technology on an ongoing basis. We strive to restrict access to your personal information to those employees who need to know that information to provide benefits or services to you. In addition, we strive to ensure that all our employees are aware of the importance of confidentiality and maintaining the privacy and security of your information.If there is an unauthorized disclosure of personal information in Britannica\u2019s possession or control, we will take steps in accordance with our written Incident Response Policy to investigate and mitigate the impact of the breach and notify affected customers in the manner required by applicable laws.Data Storage and RetentionYour personal information is stored by us using Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud storage solutions in the AWS Cloud \u2013 U.S. East (N. Virginia) Region, with backups in the AWS Cloud \u2013 Asia Pacific (Singapore) Region and Brazil (Sao Paulo) Region.

Our Compliance with Data privacy protection Statues:.5.1 We understand that Users who are under 13 years of age ('Children') need special safeguards and privacy protection, and it is the intent of the Company to fully comply with, though not limited to, COPPA (Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act), FERPA (Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act), the California Student Online Personal Information Protection Act (SOPIPA), the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA) and all other applicable state or federal student data privacy protection laws. Company does not collect personal information directly from children online at any point. Company only receives personal information about children directly from school administrators and/or teachers or parents when they set up Student accounts. Parents or legal guardians should contact their child\u2019s school to review any personal information regarding their children that the school\u2019s administrators or teachers have provided to the Company.5.2 COPPA permits a school, acting in the role of 'parent,' to provide required consent regarding the Personal Information of students who are under the age of 13. Where a school is a subscriber to our Products, we rely on this form of COPPA consent. We provide the school with this Policy, to ensure that the school, in providing its COPPA consent, has full information and assurance that our practices comply with COPPA.5.3 FERPA permits a school to provide educational records (including those that contain students\u2019 Personal Information) to certain service providers without requiring the school to obtain specific parental consent. FERPA permits this where the service provider acts as a type of 'school official' by performing services, for example, that would otherwise be performed by the school\u2019s own employees. We fulfill FERPA requirements for qualifying as a school official by, among other steps, giving the school direct control with respect to the use and maintenance of the education records at issue (including associated personal information), and refraining from re-disclosing or using this Personal Information except for purposes of providing our Products to the school. We comply with FERPA by relying on this form of consent.5.4 SOPIPA permits use of student information only for educational purposes, thereby Lumos Learning is committed to protect the privacy and security of student data and thereby expressly prohibits the use of such student data for targeted advertising and selling. We fulfill SOPIPA requirements, we do not sell, share students\u2019 data or create students\u2019 profile from students\u2019 data to third parties.

This enables. you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected,. though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us. Request erasure of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete. or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to. process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your. personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to. processing (see below), where we may have processed your information. unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply. with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with. your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to. you, if applicable, at the time of your request. Object to processing of your personal data where we are relying on a. legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about. your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on. this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data. for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we. have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which. override your rights and freedoms. Request restriction of processing of your personal data. This enables you to. ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following. scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data\u2019s accuracy; (b) where. our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c). where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you. need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have. objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have. overriding legitimate grounds to use it. Request the transfer of your personal data to you or to a third party. We. will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in. a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right. only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent. for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with. you. Withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your. personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any. processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw. your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to. you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your. consent. If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please contact. support@massolit.io.. NO FEE USUALLY REQUIRED. You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise. any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your. request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we. could refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances. WHAT WE MAY NEED FROM YOU. We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your. identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise. any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that. personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to. your request to speed up our response. TIME LIMIT TO RESPOND. We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally. it could take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex. or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and. keep you updated. GLOSSARY.

EDUCATOR USERS AND STUDENT INFORMATION.If you are a Student User using the Platform in connection with a teacher, school, or district (a 'School'), your School administrator(s) and teacher(s) ('Educator Users' and each an 'Educator User') may have the ability to access, monitor, use, edit, delete or disclose data related to Student Information. Additionally, Educator Users may create Student User accounts on behalf of students and in so doing, provide Albert with the Personal Data of students. If you are an Educator User, you agree that you will obtain and maintain all required consents from Student Users or their parents or legal guardians (when such Student Users are under the age of 13 or the age of consent in the state in which the Student resides) to allow: (i) your access, monitoring, use, editing, deleting, and disclosure of their Student Information and our providing you with the ability to do so, and (ii) your Student Users\u2019 use of the Platform.If a Student User enrolls in a 'class' created by an Educator User on the Platform, the Student User grants permission to the Educator User to view their Personal Data and Usage Data. Enrollments are done via a unique class join code, a unique class join link, direct email invitation, or an Integrated Service.If you are a Student User using the Platform in connection with a School and do not believe you or your parent or guardian has provided consent for the School or its Educator Users to access, monitor, use, edit, delete, or disclose data related to your Usage Data and Personal Data, please contact us immediately at hello@albert.io.7. SECURITY.Albert secures User Information both in transit and at rest via encryption. We use modern cryptographic algorithms like AES256 with strict user access control and multi-factor authentication.8. DATA RETENTION.We retain User Information to provide the Platform to you and our other Users and to provide a useful user experience, and not longer than is necessary to do so. When you update your User Information, we usually keep a backup copy of the prior version for a reasonable period of time in case you need to need to go back to that version.Users may deactivate their account at any time by accessing their account through the Platform. Deactivating an account means the following:.\u25cf Users will no longer be able to access their account.\u25cf No further activity may take place on the deactivated account.\u25cf User accounts will no longer be publicly visible in the Platform.\u25cf All data associated with User accounts will be kept for reporting and compliance reasons.\u25cf User Information for Student Users up until their deactivation time will continue to be shared with any Educator User(s) and the school(s) to which they belonged.\u25cf School(s) that previously had access to such data will not have access following the deactivation.A deactivated account can be restored, with all User Information intact, upon request.For Student Users who deactivate their account, except for Users (including Minor Users) who make a request for deactivation and de-identification (as discussed below), Albert will retain all of their Student Information for four years after their deactivation date. If no request for re-activation is received during that time, all Student Information will be de-identified and the account will no longer be eligible for restoration.Following the termination of a license, a School may request that we deactivate and de-identify Student Information and we will do so, unless the School or applicable regulations require the retention of such data, in which case the records shall be de-identified upon the expiration of the retention period.Minor Users (or their parents and/or guardians) may also request to deactivate and de-identify their accounts for any reason, including infancy, and we will do so. If you are a Minor User and would like to deactivate and de-identify your account for any reason, including infancy, please contact us at hello@albert.io.In the case of a request for deactivation and de-identification, the following happens:.\u25cf We will obfuscate all of the Personal Data in the relevant Student User accounts. This means that their email, first name, last name, salutation, and username get replaced with a long, meaningless identifier that is randomly assigned. This is a one way change, and we can never recover the identity associated with the account after this step. We will perform this obfuscation in our database, all backups that we maintain, and in any Service Providers that we use to deliver the Platform.\u25cf We will retain all Usage Data associated with the accounts to improve the Platform. These reasons include, but are not limited to: internal data analytics and prevention of fraud and abuse.\u25cf This action results in the deactivation of the impacted Student User accounts, preventing them from being used or restored in the future.\u25cf In order to request an account reactivation, please contact us at hello@albert.io. To request that Student Information be de-identified, please contact us at schools@albert.io.Please note that the requested deletion will be as comprehensive as possible but is always subject to issues outside of our control, including applicable regulations and laws, your actions and the actions of third parties. We may also need to retain a copy of certain information for legal compliance purposes, including, without limitation, to avoid identity theft or fraud.9. VIEWING AND CORRECTING INFORMATION.A parent or guardian may review Student Information in the applicable student\u2019s records by viewing the Student\u2019s Albert.io account. The Platform enables any Educator User to permit parents, legal guardians, and eligible pupils to review personally identifiable information contained in Student Information, and to correct erroneous information, in accordance with procedures established by the School.To the extent that a User opts to share his or her profile with his or her parent or guardian, such User expressly agrees to such sharing and all related responsibilities and liabilities therewith. Minor Users or Child Users cannot opt of sharing his or her profile with his or her parent or guardian.We fully comply with the Requirements for Accessible Electronic and Information Technology Design as laid out by the U.S. Department of Education here.10. STUDENT DATA OWNERSHIP.Any and all student data provided to Albert, or to which Albert has been granted access, are and shall remain the sole property of the educational agency or school that provided or granted access to such records.11. USERS UNDER 13 YEARS OF AGE.In accordance with the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act ('COPPA'), we require parental consent for students under the age of 13 who wish to use Albert ('Child Users'). Albert does not knowingly permit Child Users to register directly for our Platform without the consent of a Parent (defined below) or Educator User on behalf of a Parent. If Albert learns that Personal Data of a Child User has been collected on our Service without parental consent, then Albert will take appropriate steps to delete this information. If you are a parent or guardian ('Parent') and discover that your child under the age of 13 has an account with our Platform without your consent, please alert us at hello@albert.io.There are two acceptable ways for Child Users to sign up for the Platform:.1 - Self registration. When a Child User registers for our Platform, we request an active class enrollment code, birthdate, username, email, password, and a parent\u2019s email address so that we can email the Child User\u2019s Parent in order to seek consent for the Child to use the Platform. Albert does not ask the Child User for any more information than is necessary to provide the Services to the Child User or to seek parental consent. The Child User will not be able to use the Platform while request for consent from the Parent is pending. If we do not receive Parental consent within 14 days, the Child User\u2019s account will be deactivated, and their Personal Data will be deleted from our systems.2 - School registration. When the Platform is used by a School in the classroom for an educational purpose, we permit the School to create Child User accounts and to provide the requisite consent for Albert to collect User Information of a Child User for this purpose, in lieu of parental consent. Schools may create Child User accounts using tools that we provide. When Schools create accounts in this manner, we do not request additional consent from the Parent, as we require Schools to gather those consents. Similarly, when a School or Educator User invites a Child User to join the Platform and connect to an Educator User\u2019s class using a class code, we do not require parental consent as it is the responsibility of that School or Educator User to acquire parental consent for each Child User.Parents may provide consent for a Child User to use the Platform by responding affirmatively to an email sent by Albert to the Parent\u2019s email address provided by the Child User during account creation. If we do not receive consent from the Parent within fourteen 14) days, the Child User\u2019s account will be deactivated and the Child\u2019s Personal Data is deleted from our systems. Until a Parent provides consent in this manner, the Child User will be unable to meaningfully use the Platform.Parents may review their child\u2019s personal information on Albert, direct us to delete it, and refuse to allow any further collection or use of their child\u2019s information by Albert by revoking their consent. Parents seeking to revoke their consent, review their child\u2019s information, and request a deletion of their child\u2019s data should contact us at schools@albert.io.12. DATA BREACHES.Within 48 hours of learning about a data breach, or longer reasonable time as may be required by the legitimate needs of applicable law enforcement or as to take measures necessary to determine the scope of the breach and restore reasonable integrity of its systems, we will notify all Users, teachers, Parents, principals, and district administrators whose information may have been improperly disclosed, via email communication to the email address on file for each User. We will inform any Users who oversee those students (i.e. relevant teachers, Parents, principals, and district administrators) if any Student Information or Child User data is involved. This email notification will describe the nature of the data breach, the date of the breach, the types of information that were subject to the breach, and steps that are being taken to protect their Albert.io accounts going forward.13.

This Privacy Policy describes how we use and share the personal information we collect about you when you use our Platform, which includes our website (ck12.org) and related products and services (including our mobile applications). This Privacy Policy also contains information about the rights and choices you have regarding your personal information.PLEASE READ OUR ENTIRE PRIVACY POLICY CAREFULLY BEFORE USING OUR PLATFORM.1. NOTICE TO SCHOOLS.The section provides information to school districts that have entered into agreements with CK-12 Foundation (a 'Contracting School') regarding the use of our Platform by students of their school districts.Under our agreement with a Contracting School, we may receive and have access to personal information about its students. Our use of personal information about students at a Contracting School is subject to the terms of our agreement with that Contracting School. In the event of a conflict with this Privacy Policy, the terms of our agreement with a Contracting School will control to the extent the conflict is directly related to the information privacy of its students.We assist Contracting Schools in responding to requests from parents and students regarding students\u2019 information privacy. For students of a Contracting School and their parents, we may refer you to that Contracting School if you have questions about our information privacy practices.When students of a Contracting School create accounts on our Platform using their school-designated email addresses, we will treat such accounts as 'student records' and will comply with the requirements of our agreement with the Contracting School regarding the privacy of such accounts.Students of a Contracting School may also create personal accounts on our Platform using their personal email addresses. Under our agreement with a Contracting School, students\u2019 personal accounts will not be deemed part of their 'student records.'.2. CHILDREN\u2019S PRIVACY.In this Privacy Policy, we refer to the following user as a 'child':.A user located within the United States who is known by us to be under the age of 13; and.A user located in a country outside of the United States who is known by us to be under the age threshold established by the applicable children\u2019s data privacy law of that country.Children\u2019s privacy is important to us, and we do not require a child to disclose more information than necessary to participate in the Platform. Younger visitors should always check with their parents or guardians before entering information online. We encourage families to discuss their household guidelines regarding the online sharing of personal information. If we have obtained information about a child under an agreement with a Contracting School, we do not ordinarily need to obtain the parent or guardian\u2019s consent because the Contracting School has provided consent on behalf of the parent or guardian.Within the United States, we do not knowingly permit children under 13 to register on our Platform without parental consent.Outside of the United States, we take steps (as required by applicable local law) to obtain parental consent before allowing children to register on our Platform.If you are a parent or guardian of a child, you have the option to:.Review the personal information we maintain about your child;.Direct us to delete the personal information we maintain about your child; and.Request that we stop collecting or using the child\u2019s personal information.Certain personal information about your child may be posted publicly, as described in more detail below.

Exercising certain rights, such as deleting personal information, may result in your child not being able to use the Platform.3.

PERSONAL INFORMATION WE MAY COLLECT ABOUT YOU.Depending on how you use the Platform, we may collect personal information about you.

Please see the next section for that.How we process our customers\u2019 data under GDPRFull details on how we process data on schools\u2019 behalf can be found in our data sharing agreement (see downloads section), but here are some technical details:.All student data is held within the EU (see 6.3.1 of the data sharing agreements).You retain full control over what bits of data we can access.All data in transit is encrypted using SSL/TLS.Data at rest is encrypted with AES.All personal data is returned or destroyed (your choice) at the end of your license \u2013 if you don\u2019t make a choice, your instructions are that we destroy it after 6 months (see 6.3.7 of the data sharing agreements).Additionally, we are a CyberEssentials certified provider.Downloads.Manual Upload Data Sharing Agreement.MIS Intergration Data Sharing Agreement.Groupcall\u2019s GDPR statement.Wonde\u2019s GDPR statement.Parent consent letters \u2013 please click on the images below to download. FAQS What\u2019s GDPR.GDPR is the \u2018General Data Protection Regulation\u2019 \u2013 a European-wide law with some deliberate gaps which are plugged by the UK Data Protection Act 2018. It\u2019s very complicated, but in basic terms, it is a strengthening of individuals\u2019 rights in terms of what can be done by whom to their personal data. After Brexit, the GDPR will be replaced by the UK GDPR, a UK version of the GDPR.Do I have to do anything about it.If you\u2019re a parent, you don\u2019t really need to worry as the GDPR doesn\u2019t cover purely personal or household use of data. If you\u2019re a school or an institution that holds personal data in any form, absolutely. You need to take steps to ensure the data you hold on people is secure and minimised, and that the person in question is aware of what data you have on them for what purpose. You also need to ensure that any organisations you use to process (that is to say, interact with in any way) that data is up to scratch. Like us.So, what are you allowed and not allowed to do in principle.There are lots of requirements. A key one is that you need to tell people exactly what\u2019s going to happen to their data and make sure you have consent or another legal basis for using it. If the data is sensitive, you need a second legal basis on top of the first one.So if a school wants to use GCSEPod, GCSEPod needs to ask every student for consent.No. We don\u2019t control the data, we process it on your behalf. If you use GCSEPod, it is your responsibility to identify which legal basis you will rely on, whether that\u2019s consent or another legal basis from GDPR. We can\u2019t advise you on that.Is there a document that lays out what you do with data in full.Yes. It\u2019s called a data sharing agreement or a DSA, and you get one as part of the setup process. This FAQ is intended only as a primer before you read the more in depth version. You can download a copy from this page.How and where is our data stored and what security used to ensure its safety.Your data is stored in an Amazon Web Services (AWS) datacentre in Dublin, Ireland. Here\u2019s a link to the AWS white paper on security: https://d0.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/aws-security-whitepaper.pdfHere\u2019s some of our general security measures:.access to administrative functions is restricted to authorised individuals in the office and operatives in specific remote locations through the firewall.database access restricted to internal servers only with a proxy for remote management.web traffic is transferred over HTTPS.passwords are stored using one-way encryption.Servers are kept up to date with the latest security fixesHow long is personal data kept.At the end of your subscription, we can destroy or return the data as you choose. The data sharing agreement says that if you don\u2019t make that choice, your instructions are that we are to destroy the data after 6 months.How is the data destroyed when no longer needed.All personal data is anonymised so that it\u2019s completely impossible to tie an individual to any remaining data (like number of Pods watched). This renders it inert for GDPR\u2019s purposes.How do schools access the relevant data sharing agreements.Your data integration service (Wonde/XoD) displays the data sharing agreement during the setup process. Or you can download it from this page.What data does GCSEPod need from Wonde and XoD.GCSEPod needs user data: some of it mandatory (e.g. to set up user accounts) and other data optional depending on what schools want to measure: it may be useful for the school for marking and reporting on usage but not necessary. The data sharing agreement has a list of data and how it\u2019s used in GCSEPod.What else do I need to know about you.Office Address: UK Office:.Newcastle Enterprise Centres,.6 Charlotte Square, Newcastle upon Tyne NE1 4XFContact: sbl.info@theaccessgroup.comICO registration number: Z1442893Office Address: UK Office:Newcastle Enterprise Centres,.6 Charlotte Square, Newcastle upon Tyne.NE1 4XFTerms and ConditionsAccessibilityPrivacy/GDPRAwards and PartnershipsWrite for usGCSEPod is a brand of The Access Group.\u00a9 Soundbite Learning 2024.
